<h1 title="">THE BOY SCOUTS
<br />ON THE TRAIL</h1>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I.
<br /><span class="small">WHAT TOOK THE SCOUTS UP INTO MAINE.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;There never was such great luck as this,
fellows!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right there, Step Hen; and never will be
again, that&rsquo;s sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see; first, there was that silly old epidemic
breaking out in our town, and forcing the directors
to put up the bars in the school till after the Christmas
holidays; that was a great and glorious snap
for the Silver Fox Patrol of the Cranford Troop
of Boy Scouts, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that was only a beginning, Giraffe; there
were better things still headed our way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure there were, Davy. As luck would have it,
just at that same time Thad Brewster&rsquo;s guardian
found that it was mighty necessary he get word to a
gentleman by the name of James W. Carson. He
wired up to Maine, you remember, only to learn
that Mr. Carson, who was a great hunter, had
started into the big game country after moose, with
a couple of guides, and wouldn&rsquo;t be back until late
in the winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything just worked for us, seemed like,&rdquo;
remarked the boy called Davy. &ldquo;Thad suggested
that he be sent up to follow this party, and deliver
the message, and his guardian fell in with the idea
right away, didn&rsquo;t he, Thad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he was only too willing, boys; because
he knew we wanted to get up in Maine the worst
kind; ever since our comrade, Allan Hollister here,
began to tell us such splendid stories of the fun to
be had in the pine woods of his home state. But
go on, Step Hen, finish the story while you&rsquo;re about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course, when Thad, he found he could
go, that gave him an idea; and sure enough, the
whole of the patrol got the fever. Bob Quail had
to give it up, because he had too much on hand to
leave home just then; and Smithy had the hard luck
to get a touch of the plague that had dropped in on
Cranford for a visit; but didn&rsquo;t the rest of us hit it
up, though?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say we did, as sure as my name&rsquo;s Davy
Jones!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the upshot of the whole matter was that
one fine day six of us left Cranford, bound for
Maine, with all our camp stuff along; and here we
are at last, in the country of big game, canoes,
guides, tents, and everything along we need for a
month of good times, or more if we want it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t forget, Step Hen, that the one main
object of the trip is to find Mr. James W. Carson,&rdquo;
interrupted the boy named Thad; who seemed to be
looked up to as the leader of the scout patrol, which
office he really filled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; replied Step Hen, who was stretched
out comfortably by a blazing fire. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ve got
heaps of time for hunting besides, and trying out a
lot of things we&rsquo;ve been learning as scouts. It was
fine for our rich chum, Bob Quail, to insist on
handing in a big lump of coin to add to the funds
contributed by our folks. That put us on easy
street; and now, here we are, as happy as clams at
high tide, just finished our grub, and pitying the
fellows left behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Smithy; poor Bob!&rdquo; exclaimed the one
who had called himself Davy Jones.</p>
<p>There were six of them in all, and it was easy
to see from the various parts of the khaki uniforms
that were in evidence, these lads belonged to a
section of the Boy Scout organization.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>Cranford had made a start in getting a troop
together, and the first patrol of eight had been
formed for some time. Another patrol was
promised by Spring, to be followed by others as the
boys became attacked by the disease, and a desire
to learn the numerous splendid things that Boy
Scouts find out.</p>
<p>Besides the acting scoutmaster, Thad Brewster,
and his assistant, Allan Hollister, there were Step
Hen Bingham; Conrad Stedman, who on account of
his long neck went by the characteristic name of
&ldquo;Giraffe&rdquo; among his fellows; Davy Jones; and last
but far from least a short, puffy, rosy-faced boy who
had once been christened Cornelius Jasper Hawtree;
but few people ever knew it, because he was called
Bumpus by young and old alike.</p>
<p>It was a little after the nooning hour. The boys
had evidently been paddling part of the morning,
for there were three long canoes close by, with
as many men, doubtless guides, doing something to
change the luggage, so that it would allow of a more
even keel during the voyage up-stream.</p>
<p>These boys would have liked nothing better than
to have come out here by themselves, relying upon
their knowledge of woodcraft to carry them
through; for several of their number were well
versed in such things.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</div>
<p>Their parents, however, would not hear of such
a thing; and the expedition must have been wrecked
on the rocks before it really started, only that the
boys promised to take several guides along. And
besides, Allan had informed them that by the new
laws up in Maine, hunters were bound to employ
regular licensed guides when going into the woods,
to render the risk of fires less probable; since some
city men are so careless about leaving a camp-fire
burning when breaking up; and in consequence
whole districts have been burned over by the rising
wind scattering the brands among the leaves and
pine needles.</p>
<p>But those three Maine guides were promised the
easiest time of their lives; since there were so many
willing recruits to do the cooking; and lend a hand
at the paddling.</p>
<p>One canoe carried, besides Thad and Step Hen, a
dark-faced, quiet fellow, who was really a full blood
Penobscot Indian, and of course named Sebattis,
as nearly all of them seem to be.</p>
<p>The second was given over to Allan and Davy
Jones, with a young guide named Jim Hasty; who,
by the way was, about as slow and deliberate as any
one could be.</p>
<p>And the third boat had for a crew a real Maine
character, Eli Crookes, about as straight as a pine
tree; Giraffe, and Bumpus.</p>
<p>Of course the tents and various stores were
divided up so that each canoe carried its share.
Even so they seemed overloaded at times; but then
Bumpus was accustomed to declaring that the
danger of their foundering grew less day by day,
judging by the amount of eatables that disappeared
after each meal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>The fall season had set in so far that it was
getting pretty cold in the Northern Woods; and the
boys had come prepared for such severe weather
as might be expected. But they were a hearty lot,
and capable of standing almost any amount of
fatigue. Already had the outdoor life of scouts
wrought a remarkable change in several who had
been hitherto inclined to be either lazy, or indifferent
to their muscular development.</p>
<p>Bumpus Hawtree, fat little fellow that he was,
could walk twice as far now as when he first joined
the patrol; and besides, his general fund of knowledge
had increased several hundred fold.</p>
<p>Step Hen, once the most careless and indifferent
of boys, was nowadays noticing the wonderful
things that can be seen all around in Nature&rsquo;s working;
and thus he discovered that a fellow might have
a fine time, even though left alone in the woods for
a whole day!</p>
<p>Giraffe, too, had picked up amazingly; he never
seemed to take on any more flesh; but his arms and
limbs were getting like iron; and he too was beginning
to take a decided interest in affairs relating
to the trail, the camp, and life in the open generally.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>Then as to Davy Jones, who had once been known
as the &ldquo;Monkey,&rdquo; because of his indulging in all
manner of acrobatic stunts, hanging by his toes from
a high limb of a tree; standing on his head; walking
on his hands; and turning back somersaults without
the slightest warning, just as though he belonged to
a circus&mdash;even Davy was beginning to tone down
somewhat, and his breaks were not quite so
numerous.</p>
<p>Of late however, strange to say, Bumpus had
manifested an odd fascination for imitating some
of the tricks to which the acrobatic Davy was
addicted. He had begun to even fancy that he was
actually becoming supple, and could copy Davy with
ease.</p>
<p>When these rivalries did not seem to be along a
dangerous line Thad wisely kept quiet, knowing
that Bumpus would speedily realize his inability to
compare with the active one; and besides they often
afforded a deal of amusement for the balance of
the patrol.</p>
<p>While the three guides were making sure that the
last spark of their late camp-fire had been extinguished,
by pouring water from the river upon the
ashes, the boys were taking their places in the boats.</p>
<p>Davy was feeling particularly frisky; and resting
his hands, one upon either gunwale of the canoe,
close to the bow, where he had his position for the
afternoon, he threw himself up, with his heels in
the air, cracking these together sharply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that, fellows?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you call that a pretty good poise? Why, I guess I
could do it even if we were shooting the rapids.
Hey, Bumpus, that&rsquo;s one on you, all right,&rdquo; and the
heels cracked together suggestively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe you think I ain&rsquo;t got the nerve to try that
cute little dodge,&rdquo; remarked the fat boy, aggressively.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done a heap of things you thought I
couldn&rsquo;t. Now, you just wait and see your Dutch
uncle show you a stunt worth two of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Careful, Bumpus, the water&rsquo;s deep right here!&rdquo;
called out Thad, whose back happened to be turned
toward the other canoe just then, as he was changing
some of the stuff, so as to give his legs more
room when he took the paddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And likewise cold!&rdquo; added Giraffe, who was
grinning with anticipation of the fun that was coming.</p>
<p>But Bumpus was in deadly earnest. He gripped
the sides of his canoe, just as he had seen Davy do;
and then, giving a flirt into the air, started to extend
his dumpy lower limbs upward.</p>
<p>But alas! Bumpus did not know how to stop
going, once he got started. The consequence was,
that instead of remaining at an exact perpendicular,
his body kept on turning until he could no longer
maintain his desperate grip on the narrow gunwales
of the canvas canoe. And as a shout broke out
from several of the scouts, poor Bumpus went over
the bow into the water; where he made a splash
that must have dreadfully alarmed every speckled
trout that had not yet taken up its winter quarters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II.
<br /><span class="small">THE TROUBLES OF BUMPUS.</span></h2>
<p>With the splash the three guides looked up from
their task at the fire, and then turned toward each
other with grins. These boys were a lively lot, and
kept things moving all the time; but already had
the guides come to like them more than a little.
But if one of the lads chose to go in swimming
with his clothes on, of course it was none of their
business. So they did not run to the rescue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow! gimme a hand, somebody!&rdquo; spluttered
poor Bumpus, as his head came up, and he sent out
a little Niagara of water that he had started to
swallow in his excitement.</p>
<p>Bumpus could swim, and there was not the least
danger of his drowning; so none of the other boys
manifested a frantic desire to help him. Indeed,
Giraffe even showed himself heartless enough to
give vent to a hearty laugh; while Davy Jones immediately
called out:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bumpus, you never said a truer word in your
whole life; that <i>was</i> a stunt worth two of mine.
When it comes to doing <i>real</i> things, with the splash
to &rsquo;em, I&rsquo;m a back number compared with you. Oh!
you Bumpus!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing that no one was going to do more than
extend a paddle toward him, the indignant fat boy
started to paddle ashore; where he crawled out of
the water, looking like a half drowned rat, as Step
Hen took occasion to tell him.</p>
<p>But as the fire was out, and the air rather chilly,
although in the middle of a glorious fall day, wise
Thad knew that the boys stood a chance of getting
cold unless he quickly changed his clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Giraffe, overhaul his clothes bag, and get
out his extra duds,&rdquo; the scoutmaster remarked, in a
tone of authority, which the elongated boy understood
permitted of no nonsense; so he condescended
to act as valet for the unfortunate Bumpus, selecting
the garments he was to wear, and offering some
of his own in case the other did not have a complete
assortment.</p>
<p>As Giraffe was as tall and skinny as Bumpus was
fat and rotund, it would have been an utter impossibility
for the latter to have worn anything belonging
to his fellow voyager, even had he needed
assistance.</p>
<p>Fortunately he had plenty for a complete change,
and a sweater which Thad insisted he should draw
on over the shirt, gave promise of preventing any
serious result from the ducking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wasted just twenty minutes, all on account of
Bumpus&rsquo;s vaulting ambition,&rdquo; remarked Step Hen,
when they were finally ready to make a fresh start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vaulting ambition is good,&rdquo; observed Davy
Jones, with a wink at Allan, who sat near him in
the second canoe. &ldquo;Now, d&rsquo;ye know, I&rsquo;ve tried
that stunt many a time, but I never yet was able to
get one-half the fun out of it that Bumpus did the
first shot. No use talking, he can see me, and go
one better. I&rsquo;ll have to take in my sign, and retire
from business, boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; grunted the object of all this side
talk, and there was a twinkle in his eye as he looked
at Davy; &ldquo;I made the biggest splash you ever
heard; all of you have just got to admit that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly did, Bumpus,&rdquo; said Thad; &ldquo;but
I&rsquo;d advise you to be a little more careful after this
how you try to copy Davy Jones. To tell the honest
truth, though I don&rsquo;t want to hurt your feelings,
Bumpus, but, you see, you&rsquo;re hardly built for doing
most of the things he shows off in. If it was
Giraffee here, instead, he might have a look-in.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But Giraffe, he&rsquo;s just a little too smart to get
caught trying; he cut his eye teeth some time ago;&rdquo;
remarked that individual. &ldquo;But I give you all warning
that from now on I am going to try some of
those different ways of making fires without using
a single match. I&rsquo;ve got a burning glass along;
then there&rsquo;s my fine flint and steel, like our forefathers
owned in the good old pioneer days; and
last but not least, I&rsquo;d just bent on using a bow and
a stick in the manner they say the South Sea
islanders do. You wait and see me show you something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad moved a little uneasily at hearing this.
Truth to tell, he had had considerable trouble with
the tall scout in times past, on account of this very
failing, which was once more coming to the surface.</p>
<p>Giraffe seemed to be a regular fire worshipper.
It was a subject that went away ahead of all others
in his mind. Indeed, there were some of his mates
who declared that the long-legged scout had really
joined the patrol in order to find chances to indulge
in his favorite pursuit, which was to see the flames
creep upward, snapping and glowing. Giraffe, having
started a blaze, would sit there and gaze into
the heart of the fire, just as though he could discover
the most wonderful things there.</p>
<p>As a rule, he occupied much of his spare time
when in camp whittling; and if asked what he was
doing, would reply that possibly they might want to
start a fresh fire later on, and he was getting the
tinder ready.</p>
<p>His folks had had more or less trouble with him
at home on this same account; as on three separate
occasions the fire department had been called on a
run to save the Stedham home, when the boy, in
pursuing his investigations, had endangered it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>And now, it seemed that his latest fad was to try
every kind of known method for bringing about a
flame without the use of a match. No wonder Thad
felt uneasy. He knew about the stringent laws of
Maine with regard to setting the woods afire; and
with such a reckless lad loose among the pines it
would be necessary for some one to keep control
over Giraffe pretty much all the time.</p>
<p>The afternoon began to wane as they pushed on
up the current of the river. The guides had informed
the boys that there was still a short time
when trout could be legally taken, as the fishing
season overlapped the hunting term a week or two.
And hence a couple of jointed rods had been
brought along, with the idea of making use of
them. A platter of deliciously browned trout was
a dish that appealed to the appetites of these boys
tremendously, and right now Thad was keeping
Allan on the lookout for a tempting spot, where it
seemed likely they might gather in a mess of the
speckled beauties.</p>
<p>All at once Bumpus was seen to half rise from
his seat in the bottom of the canoe in which he had
a place. Thad noticed that the fat boy seemed
strangely moved, as though distressed over something.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What ails you, Bumpus?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I hope
you don&rsquo;t feel the effect of your bath. This sun has
been fairly warm, and by now you ought to be
feeling all right, especially after doing your share of
paddling for an hour or so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t that,&rdquo; said Bumpus, weakly; &ldquo;but I
guess I ought to turn around, and go back, fellers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; cried Step Hen, &ldquo;go right over the end of
the canoe; the walking on the water is fine, Bumpus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Thad saw that the other was really distressed
about something that had suddenly come
into his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should you go back, Bumpus, when you
know well enough it&rsquo;s out of the question?&rdquo; he
demanded. &ldquo;Have you forgotten something?
Thought we left all that to Step Hen here, who&rsquo;s
forever losing his possessions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, I did forget, Thad,&rdquo; replied the
other, with a forlorn look on his face, that would
have made the scoutmaster laugh, only that he
realized Bumpus was suffering mentally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget what, Bumpus?&rdquo; asked Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you, fellers,&rdquo; continued the fat boy,
with a sigh that seemed to come from the very
depths of his heart. &ldquo;Just before I started off on
this glorious trip with you my father handed me
a letter which he said he wanted me to take right
away to Mr. Harriman, the cashier of the Cranford
Bank, as it was <i>very</i> important that he should have
it before noon that day. I was just trying to remember
whether I did go there and give it to him or not;
and d&rsquo;ye know, for the life of me I just can&rsquo;t make
sure of it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny!&rdquo; exclaimed Giraffe. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you
able to recollect seeing the gentleman, or anything
he said to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other shook his head sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the queer part of it,&rdquo; he declared.
&ldquo;Sometimes it comes to me that I must have done
it, and I think I see it all plain before me. Then it
gets mixed, and I&rsquo;m not so sure. You see, here&rsquo;s
what bothers me. That same morning I met a
friend who was going about ten miles off in his
dad&rsquo;s machine, and he asked me to have a spin with
him. Just couldn&rsquo;t resist, boys, and we did go
licketty-split. I&rsquo;m telling you right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw you go past our house, riding for fair,&rdquo;
remarked Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us the rest, Bumpus; what had that ride
in a car to do with the important letter your father
gave you to be delivered at the bank?&rdquo; asked Davy
Jones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A heap, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; answered the other, making
a wry face. &ldquo;I can just remember that my
coat managed to break loose, and was flapping in
the wind before I was able to grab it shut, and
button it again. And fellers, I had a glimpse of
something white, like a letter, that had slipped out
of my pocket, and was carried over the fence into
Brainard&rsquo;s woods!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wow! and again, wow!&rdquo; exclaimed Giraffe,
that being his favorite way of expressing surprise
and interest in anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought at the time that it must be only a scrap
of waste paper I happened to be carrying in my
pocket; but fellers, it just broke in on me a little
while back that it <i>might</i> have been that very important
letter I was to give to Mr. Harriman at the
bank!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! the chances are ten to one it wasn&rsquo;t,
Bumpus,&rdquo; said Thad, who saw that the scout was
really dreadfully worried, and in a fair way to
have his whole vacation trip to the woods spoiled
by over anxiety.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;re right, Thad, and it&rsquo;s kind of you
to bolster up my hopes like you do; but then, there
is one chance, you see, that I lost that document;
and I&rsquo;m wondering right now what it could be.
Oh! what if it was so important that my folks
would suffer because I lost it? Think how I&rsquo;d
feel if I came home after having the time of my life
up here, and found all the household stuff out on
the street, and the red flag of an auctioneer telling
people that the Stedman place was for sale? Whew!
it makes me feel chilly all over just to think of
what I may have done. Then I just say to myself
that of course you delivered that letter Bumpus
Stedman; you couldn&rsquo;t be so wrapped up in getting
ready for the start on this jaunt as to just forget
all about it. And now, it&rsquo;s too late to go back, and
I&rsquo;ve just got to worry and worry until I lose pounds
every day. And perhaps, when we go back, I&rsquo;ll be a
living skeleton, like Giraffe here. Oh! that&rsquo;s the
worst of it. Better learn to quit callin&rsquo; me Bumpus,
fellers, because right soon it won&rsquo;t fit at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheer up!&rdquo; said Thad, &ldquo;and sooner or later
you&rsquo;re sure to remember something that Mr. Harriman
said or did, when you handed him the letter;&rdquo;
but poor Bumpus only shook his head sadly, and
sighed again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III.
<br /><span class="small">A STRANGE DISCOVERY.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;How about this for a camp site, Thad?&rdquo; asked
Allan, half an hour later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks fishy around here, for a fact,&rdquo; remarked
Step Hen, just as if he knew all about such things;
when, truth to tell, he had a lot to learn before he
could call himself much of a woodsman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if there&rsquo;s any chance of finding that
bee tree you said you was goin&rsquo; to show me some
time, when we got up in Maine?&rdquo; spoke up Bumpus;
who had managed for the time being to put his
troubles out of his mind; for Thad assured him
that after sleeping over it, most likely he would
remember some little incident connected with his
entering the bank on that last morning in Cranford,
and which would prove to his satisfaction that he
<i>must</i> have delivered the letter there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Allan, the Maine boy, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s pretty
late in the season to talk about bee trees, for I
doubt if we&rsquo;ll find any of the little buzzers flying;
and it&rsquo;s really necessary to have that happen in
order to locate the hive; but I&rsquo;m going to keep my
eye open all the time, Bumpus, and try and accommodate
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But just think of gettin&rsquo; whole heaps of rich
ripe honey!&rdquo; ejaculated Giraffe, who dearly loved
eating; &ldquo;say, wouldn&rsquo;t we have flapjacks every
morning then, boys, with honey to smear over them
an inch thick? Um! um! take me to that bee tree
as soon as you locate it, Allan, and give me an axe.
I promise to cut her down, remember that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I hope to hold you to that promise,
Giraffe,&rdquo; returned the assistant patrol leader. &ldquo;But
what d&rsquo;ye say, Thad, shall we stop here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do the guides say; how about it, Sebattis,
Eli, Jim; will we be apt to pick up a mess of trout
here, do you think?&rdquo; and Thad turned to the
bronzed Maine men, who nodded their heads, and
one after the other promised that if the boys knew
how to handle their rods, there should be little
difficulty in securing all they wanted, for a better
pool could not be found along the river.</p>
<p>A little side stream came into the main river with
a noisy rush, falling from a ledge; and under the
cascade there was a very deep place, where the
trout were likely to stay until the coming of thick
ice caused them to bury themselves in the mud,
after the fashion of most fish, until the ice went out
in the spring.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>Accordingly a landing was made, and soon all was
bustle, the boys working with the three guides, as
became true scouts, eager to learn all the little
wrinkles of life in the open.</p>
<p>The tents were soon erected. There were just two
of these; and as this was apt to make it rather
crowded, the guides had offered to sleep outside
except on any real stormy nights. They were
hardened to the weather, and thought little of such
a small matter.</p>
<p>Of course Giraffe looked after making the fireplace,
for he would not hear of anybody else having
anything to do with that part of the programme.
And Thad generally let the tall scout have his own
way about this one matter; he fancied that it might
keep Giraffe out of mischief; as well as employ his
time, and save the guides considerable work.</p>
<p>And Giraffe certainly did extract more pleasure
in making a fine cooking fire than any one Thad
had ever seen. After supper was done he usually
insisted on having a rousing camp-fire, around which
they could sit with hands clasped about their knees;
or else lie in comfortable attitudes on their several
blankets, while they coaxed the guides to tell them
stories of the woods, and the big animals they had
come in contact with during the years spent in
serving hunting parties on the trail of deer and
moose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>Jim and Eli did about all the talking, for it was
difficult to get Sebattis to say anything about his
experiences; though every one just knew the old
Indian must be &ldquo;as full of thrilling yarns as an
egg is of meat,&rdquo; as Step Hen put it.</p>
<p>Thad and Allan meanwhile had taken their rods,
and set to work trying to coax the shy trout to bite
the bait they offered them. Both boys were good
fishermen, and had had considerable experience in
the ways of the speckled beauties; so that in the end
they succeeded in getting a pretty mess of the trout,
enough to give them a fine feast that evening.</p>
<p>One of the guides was set to work cleaning the fish
even before the boys stopped taking them in; and
about the time the sun sank out of sight in the west,
a most delicious odor began to arise, that Giraffe
sniffed, with his eyes glistening; for this was the
first mess of trout they had caught on this expedition.</p>
<p>Later on the whole of them sat around the fire, and
enjoyed one of the most tasty dishes ever placed
before a hungry boy&mdash;fresh brook trout, rolled in
cracker crumbs, and done to a turn in hot grease
extracted from several pieces of salt pork.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only hope we get a few more chances to feast
on this thing before the season&rsquo;s up, or the cold
drives the trout into winter quarters,&rdquo; remarked
Giraffe, as he heaved a sigh of regret because the
pan was now empty&mdash;for eight hungry people it was
of course necessary to use both large skillets, and
even then the supply never exceeded the demand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But why should we bother our heads about the
season, when we&rsquo;re away up here, and with no one
to know what we&rsquo;re doing?&rdquo; demanded Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it, Step Hen,&rdquo; replied Thad, who
seemed to think the question was intended for
him; &ldquo;we&rsquo;re Boy Scouts, and when we joined the
organization every one of us subscribed to certain
rules, twelve in number, you remember. Could you
repeat those twelve cardinal principles of the scouts
for me right now, Step Hen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy addressed turned a little red in the face;
while the two Maine guides listened intently,
evidently very much interested. Sebattis did not
seem to pay the least attention to what was going
on; though that may just have been his way. These
Indian guides have a habit of hearing, when nobody
expects it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! sure, I can,&rdquo; Step Hen made answer, cheerfully
enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then please let us hear them,&rdquo; continued Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the scout went on to say, as if he easily
knew the list by heart; &ldquo;he promises to the best of
his ability to be trustworthy, loyal, helpful to others,
friendly, courteous, kind, obedient to his superiors,
cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean and reverent.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Step Hen,&rdquo; the scoutmaster remarked,
&ldquo;the great State of Maine trusts us. We&rsquo;ve taken
out licenses to shoot, up here. We&rsquo;re entitled to a
certain number of deer, and one moose apiece.
And in accepting these favors we virtually agreed
to refrain from breaking the laws. Can a scout be
trustworthy who deliberately breaks a law, like the
killing of game, or the taking of fish out of season,
when there&rsquo;s no real excuse for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, p&rsquo;raps you&rsquo;re right, Thad,&rdquo; grumbled the
other, rather loth to see the point; &ldquo;but s&rsquo;pose now,
I was lost in these here big pine woods, and hungry
near to starving. I knew the season for trout was
up, but it was a case of &lsquo;root hog, or die,&rsquo; with poor
Step Hen. Would you blame me then, if I just
dropped a line to Mr. Trout and invited him to
waltz into my little frying-pan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There may be cases where breaking the game
law is justifiable,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m not saying
otherwise. I think that would be one of them.
A fellow shouldn&rsquo;t be compelled to starve, with
game around him, because certain men have decided
that as a rule the laws ought to be made just so and
so. But Step Hen, if he were really just to his
better self, I believe that scout would, when he had
reached a point of safety, go to a game warden,
state the case, and offer to pay the fine, if it had to
be imposed. I rather guess the great state of Maine
would do the generous thing, and remit such a
fine.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that lets Giraffe out, I see,&rdquo; remarked the
still unconvinced Step Hen. &ldquo;Because he&rsquo;s always
at the starving point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same, boys, as true scouts, I hope none
of you will bring discredit on the name of the Silver
Fox Patrol by doing anything that is going to get
us into trouble, in case we happen to meet a game
warden. For one I&rsquo;d like to look him in the eye,
and feel my conscience clear,&rdquo; and after that Thad
changed the subject, with the hope that the weak
member might, when he had digested all that had
been said, see the thing in its best light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing we don&rsquo;t want to forget,&rdquo;
Thad remarked later on, as some of the boys began
to manifest a desire for a little &ldquo;rough house&rdquo;
time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, Thad?&rdquo; asked Allan, though
doubtless he could already give a fair guess as to
what the reply was going to be, since he had seen
signs of a frown on the forehead of the scoutmaster
when the noise broke out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t forget,&rdquo; said Thad, &ldquo;that right
now we&rsquo;re on the border of the big game country,
and any time we&rsquo;re apt to run across signs of deer
and moose. Now, when hunters who know their
business go into the wilderness, they don&rsquo;t kick up a
row, and make all sorts of a racket that would tell
the timid woods&rsquo; folks a delegation of town people
had invaded their haunts. If they did, they&rsquo;d not
be apt to find Mr. Moose within twenty miles.
How about that, Allan?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Thad,&rdquo; replied the Maine boy,
smiling. &ldquo;Most of the deer hunters are what we
call still hunters. They look for their game, and
creep up on it from the leeward side, with the wind
coming from the deer. There is no dog chasing deer
allowed in the state, or in New York, any longer; so
the noise and excitement is all gone. And in a
noisy camp you&rsquo;ll find mighty few deer taken. It&rsquo;s
the quiet, earnest fellows who succeed in getting the
game up here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hear that, scouts,&rdquo; said Thad, pleasantly.
&ldquo;We want game the worst kind, as well as to overtake
that gentleman who is ahead of us, and whose
trail we&rsquo;re now following. So if you please, we&rsquo;ll
dispense with the usual bugle blasts, and the horse
play, while in camp here. Let&rsquo;s have a jolly good
time, which I believe is possible among boys, without
wrestling, and singing, and rough play. Am I
right, Step Hen, Giraffe, Davy, Bumpus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are, every time, Thad,&rdquo; said Bumpus, and
the other three were quick to take their cue; so that
from this hour it seemed likely that the scouts who
were for the time being playing the part of big
game hunters, meant to carry out the r&ocirc;le to the
letter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>Jim looked at Eli, nodded his head, and winked.
It was as though one guide had said to the other
that Thad Brewster knew his business, all right.</p>
<p>About half an hour later Step Hen was seen to be
moving about in the bushes near the edge of the
camp, with his head bent low. Now, every one knew
what such an attitude meant when it was Step Hen
who assumed it. He had lost something, as usual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s gone this time, Step Hen?&rdquo; asked Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That little jinx been around again, hooking your
things?&rdquo; demanded Giraffe, who always made all
manner of fun of the careless scout whenever he
complained that he was unable to find a certain
thing, which he felt just sure he had laid aside only
a minute before.</p>
<p>As usual Step Hen was simply positive that he
could not have himself mislaid his property.
Proven guilty on numerous previous occasions did
not seem to convince the boy that he could ever do
such a silly thing again. This was always a case of
where some mischievous chum had been playing a
trick on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s that little bundle I fetched along, with
a black piece of waterproof cloth around it, torn
from an old rain coat,&rdquo; he explained, as he continued
to poke among the bushes. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s got some
things in it that I thought I&rsquo;d likely need up here,
in case I happened to get lost; among others, a cute
little compass, an extra box of parlor matches that
you just can&rsquo;t blow out in any wind, and some other
little wrinkles.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds all to the good, Step Hen,&rdquo; Thad went
on to remark; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve no doubt that if you ever
did have the misfortune to get lost, while up here
in Maine, that same little packet would come in
mighty handy, providing you chanced to have it
with you at the time. If it was in camp, why, it
couldn&rsquo;t do you any good. But what makes you
think it&rsquo;s gone now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had it in my hand not ten minutes ago, and
laid it carefully aside,&rdquo; Step Hen went on, in a
whining tone as though he felt hurt; but which was
doubtless only assumed for the purpose of arousing
sympathy; &ldquo;oh! you can grin as much as you want,
Giraffe and Davy, but it&rsquo;s so, <i>this time</i>. I was careful
as could be. And now, she&rsquo;s gone. I just know
one of you fellers scooped that packet, and hid the
same in the bushes, just to give me a rough jolt.
And that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m hunting for it right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad was on his feet at the time; and with a smile
at the old complaint, which he had heard Step Hen
make, time without end, only to find himself compelled
to &ldquo;eat his words,&rdquo; as Giraffe put it, he
sauntered away, meaning to take a little look
around, before turning in.</p>
<p>Two minutes later Step Hen gave a little gurgling
cry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Found it?&rdquo; asked Giraffe, with an interested
air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just like I said was the case,&rdquo; came from Step
Hen, in the bushes close by. &ldquo;The feller that took
it just gave it a flirt, and over she came, right here.
What! Well, I declare that&rsquo;s mighty funny now,&rdquo;
and he pushed his way into view carrying some
object in his hand, at which he was staring incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, that ain&rsquo;t your package, is it, Step Hen?&rdquo;
demanded Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say it wasn&rsquo;t;&rdquo; replied the other scout;
&ldquo;but tell me, fellers, how in the wide world now,
d&rsquo;ye suppose this came in them bushes?&rdquo; and he
held up what seemed to be a small hand-bag of black
leather, apparently weighty, and very much
used.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV.
<br /><span class="small">THE IGNORANCE OF STEP HEN.</span></h2>
<p>All of them, guides as well as scouts, stared at
the strange object which Step Hen was holding up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like a little hand-bag of leather; but it&rsquo;s
been used a heap, I reckon,&rdquo; suggested Davy Jones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what she is,&rdquo; replied Step Hen, as he
lowered the article; and something in his manner
of doing this impelled Giraffe to remark:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon she must be kinder heavy, Step Hen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heft it for yourself, and see,&rdquo; replied the other,
as Giraffe came to his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! I should say, yes!&rdquo; declared the tall
member of the patrol, as he lifted the old black
hand-bag, and held it out in a horizontal position for
a few seconds. &ldquo;All of five pounds there, if there&rsquo;s
a single one. Now, what d&rsquo;ye suppose is in that
thing?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And how did it ever come in them bushes; that&rsquo;s
what gets me?&rdquo; queried Step Hen, staring at the
bag, which he had taken again, as though half
inclined to suspect that the mischievous little jinx,
whom Giraffe always said played these mean tricks
on him, might possess the power to change his black
package into this weatherbeaten little bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s old, you c&rsquo;n see,&rdquo; remarked Giraffe,
carelessly. &ldquo;P&rsquo;raps the hunter that carried it up
here got sick of his bargain; and slipping a few
rocks inside, to weigh it down, he just gave her a
heave out of sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think so?&rdquo; remarked Step Hen. &ldquo;Well, anyhow,
it don&rsquo;t look a bit like that lost package of
mine, does it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you open it up,&rdquo; suggested Allan; &ldquo;it
might be you&rsquo;d find your missing things inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doubtless he only said this in a spirit of fun,
in order to hasten Step Hen; but the other took it
seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, however in the wide world would my
packet come in here, Allan?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;None of
the boys ever set eyes on this bag before, have you,
fellers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe, Davy, and Bumpus thereupon solemnly
raised, each one his right hand, and declared that to
the best of their knowledge and belief they had
never glimpsed that same bag until their comrade
carried it out of the bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, open her up, Step Hen, and let&rsquo;s see the
kind of rocks it&rsquo;s got inside,&rdquo; Giraffe demanded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>Whereupon Step Hen proceeded to cautiously
test the catch of the bag. Finding that it would give
readily, he pressed it further, and then drew back
the jaws of the leather receptacle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rocks?&rdquo; he ejaculated, scornfully, just as if he
had never taken the least stock in that far-fetched
theory himself; &ldquo;what d&rsquo;ye call that, fellers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had thrust in a hand, and was now holding
something aloft. The dancing light from the campfire
shone upon the object, which seemed to glisten
like polished steel.</p>
<p>Immediately Giraffe set up a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I declare, fellers,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;some
poor old carpenter&rsquo;s gone and lost his kit of tools.
Shows that Step Hen ain&rsquo;t the only loony wanderin&rsquo;
about in these here pine woods, droppin&rsquo; his things
around loose, and then forgettin&rsquo; where he put &rsquo;em.
And to think it should be the same sort of one that
found these tools. Ain&rsquo;t that a queer case,
though?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carpenter&rsquo;s tools,&rdquo; Step Hen went on, indignantly,
as he held up a second, and then other
articles, which he took from the bag; &ldquo;did you ever
watch a carpenter at work, Giraffe; and did you
ever see him use tools like them? If you did, then
believe me, that feller ought to a been in the lock-up,
that&rsquo;s what.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lock-up!&rdquo; repeated Giraffe after him, and he
stared at Step Hen as though he believed the other
might be trying to play some sort of a joke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, in the lock-up,&rdquo; the other scout
went on, firmly. &ldquo;When I was down to New York
with my dad last year, he had to see the Police
Commissioner about a little business; and they were
old friends too. I went along, and sat there in one
of the offices nigh an hour. To amuse myself, I
examined the heaps of queer things they had there,
which I reckoned had been taken from all sorts of
crooks that&rsquo;d been arrested for years. And in the
lot I saw some tools mighty like these, boys!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow, and again I say, wow!&rdquo; murmured
Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thieves&rsquo; tools, hey?&rdquo; grunted Bumpus, pushing
forward to handle some of the shiny articles himself.
&ldquo;P&rsquo;raps now, one of these here might be what
they call a jimmy, and another a centerbit. I always
used to read about such things in every story in the
papers of a burglary down in the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davy also wanted to examine the things at close
range, and so they were passed around. Even the
two guides seemed to take a deep interest in the
contents of the little old black bag; and for several
minutes a buzz followed, as each voiced his opinion
concerning the merits of the tools to accomplish
such a job as breaking into a strong box of a bank.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But just stop and think,&rdquo; remarked Step Hen,
presently, &ldquo;how far this is from any town where
these fellers could use their tools. No wonder they
hid &rsquo;em in the bushes right here. The only thing
they could expect to break into up here would be the
game laws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or the river,&rdquo; suggested Giraffe, with a sly
glance toward Bumpus, who flashed him back a
scornful look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My opinion is, fellows,&rdquo; observed Allan, who
thus far had not taken any part in the earnest discussion,
&ldquo;that these things might never have been lost
at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! then you think they hid &rsquo;em here?&rdquo; asked
Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Either that, or else just tossed them away, to
get rid of carrying such a heavy package any
longer,&rdquo; the Maine boy went on. &ldquo;Such men would
never come up here to camp out, or to hunt. Only
one thing would be apt to tempt them to dive into
the woods like this; they expected to be hunted, and
are on the way to the Canada border as fast as they
can pack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somehow, the idea seemed to please the rest of
the scouts; and even Jim and Eli nodded their
heads, as though they quite agreed with Allan, after
he had evolved the suggestion, which likely enough
would have never occurred to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, d&rsquo;ye suppose, now,&rdquo; Giraffe asked, &ldquo;that
these jail birds could have cracked a crib before they
took to the woods?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, just as like as not,&rdquo; answered Allan;
&ldquo;though we can&rsquo;t tell that so easy. They must have
tried to get away with some loot, though, and found
the officers hot after them. So, to escape being
caught they&rsquo;ve taken to the woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that might be jumpin&rsquo; from the frying-pan
into the fire,&rdquo; Davy declared. &ldquo;If they happened to
be greenhorns, now, it&rsquo;d be apt to go hard with &rsquo;em
up here, with the winter comin&rsquo; on, p&rsquo;raps no
blankets along, and only a little grub. Huh! they
might even wish they&rsquo;d let the officers ketch &rsquo;em.
Three meals, such as they are in jail, are better than
nothin&rsquo; to eat in the wilderness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Allan went on to say, &ldquo;the chances are,
they had a fellow along who knew more or less
about what to do in the woods, and what not to do;
because you see, they seemed to get up this far all
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if there was a big reward out for their
capture, and we managed to crowd the bunch to the
wall?&rdquo; suggested Bumpus, enviously. &ldquo;Say, we&rsquo;d
be fixed then for a lot more of outings, wouldn&rsquo;t
we, fellers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allan laughed. It was so strange to hear Bumpus,
usually the most peaceable of the entire patrol, speak
in so fierce a tone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t stop to mention what these desperate
chaps would be doing all that time, Bumpus,&rdquo; he
remarked, drily. &ldquo;There must be two of them,
perhaps more; and it stands to reason that they&rsquo;re
hard cases, ready to fight at the drop of the hat. I
guess we&rsquo;ll have to just attend to our own affairs,
and let the sheriff look after these jail birds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if we happened to run foul of them,
wouldn&rsquo;t we be doin&rsquo; the right thing to try and grab
the lot?&rdquo; demanded Bumpus, loth to admit defeat
when he had been conjuring up a bright idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, if it could be done without too much
risk,&rdquo; replied the assistant scoutmaster, readily
enough. &ldquo;Such men are outlaws to society, and
it&rsquo;s the duty and privilege, I&rsquo;ve heard my father say,
of all honest persons to capture them, in case the
chance comes along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a rifle or a shotgun apiece; and each
of the guides is provided with his gun too, so we
ought to turn the trick easy enough,&rdquo; Bumpus continued.
&ldquo;Eight determined men against two, or
p&rsquo;raps three, you see. They may be tough characters,
when they&rsquo;re in cities, but I just bet you now
their old knees knock together if they saw a row
of eight firearms all aimin&rsquo; at their heads. That&rsquo;s
talkin&rsquo; some.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I should say it was, from you, Bumpus,&rdquo; remarked
Allan; &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t get too anxious to come
to close quarters with these men. I can give a guess
what they&rsquo;re like. I&rsquo;ve seen what they call yeggs
before now, roving burglars who play the part of
tramps, so as to get a chance to look country banks
over, and break in some dark night, when the town
people are sound asleep. And I want to tell you,
boys, I don&rsquo;t like the breed. If I have my choice
I&rsquo;m going to mind my own business, and let the
law officers attend to theirs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; broke in Davy Jones, &ldquo;up here our
business is first of all following the trail of Mr.
Carson and his two guides; and after that, to get
just as much hunting of the big game as we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you going to do with all these clever little
tools, Step Hen?&rdquo; asked Giraffe. &ldquo;I hope now,
you don&rsquo;t expect to tote &rsquo;em along with you? If
they turned out too heavy for the fleeing yeggmen to
keep, think of how you&rsquo;ll suffer. Better give &rsquo;em a
heave into the bushes again, and say good-bye.
They might get you into a peck of trouble, boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; remarked Step Hen, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
keep the bag till mornin&rsquo; anyhow, an&rsquo; then let Thad
say whether we want to pick out a few of these
things, just to remember the affair by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laid the numerous tools in a heap beside him,
and then turned the old hand-bag over, as though
meaning to clean it out before replacing the contents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;Oh! I
thought at first it was another tool; but seems like
it&rsquo;s only an old stick of dirty gray mud. Queer how
that could a got in this bag, ain&rsquo;t it? Whatever did
them yeggmen want carryin&rsquo; hard mud around with
&rsquo;em, I wonder?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>He drew his hand back, evidently with the intention
of throwing the article into the blaze, when a
hand clutched his wrist, and the voice of Thad, a bit
husky, sounded close to his ear:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on! don&rsquo;t you think of tossing that into
the fire, Step Hen! Why, are you crazy? Didn&rsquo;t
you ever see such a thing before in your life. No
wonder Allan, there, was nearly scared to death
when he saw what you meant to do; because Step
Hen, this stick of innocent mud, as you called it, is
really dynamite!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Step Hen weakly allowed his hand to open, and
the scoutmaster possessed himself of the deadly
four-inch stick of explosive.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V.
<br /><span class="small">THE TELL-TALE TRACKS.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Dynamite!&rdquo; echoed Giraffe as his face
blanched. &ldquo;And the silly was just goin&rsquo; to give it
a heave into the fire. Great governor! what would
have happened to the Silver Fox Patrol if he had?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t mention it, Giraffe,&rdquo; said poor Step
Hen, weakly, &ldquo;However was I to know what it
was, when I hadn&rsquo;t ever seen such a thing before in
all my life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked Thad, grimly, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the
time you should have remembered that a scout must
always be prepared to think for himself, and observe
too. I heard something of what was said as I stood
here, watching. You had guessed easily enough
that these were the tools with which bank burglars
break into safes. And since you read the papers,
Step Hen, you must surely know that they often use
dynamite to burst open the lock of a safe. You
never stopped to think, that&rsquo;s the trouble. All you
had to do would be to say to yourself, &lsquo;now, what
would thieves be likely to have this for, because it
must enter into their business?&rsquo; and the chances
were ten to one you&rsquo;d have guessed it, right away.
Think twice after this, Step Hen, before you do a
rash thing like that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>The scoutmaster spoke more sternly than was his
wont when dealing with those who were under his
charge; because he had been horrified and thrilled
when he realized the terrible danger that hovered
over them all, should Step Hen manage to give the
innocent looking stick a toss into the fire, before he
could leap alongside, and stay his arm.</p>
<p>Perhaps the dynamite might not have exploded
before he could with a frantic effort dislodge it from
the burning brands; but the chances of its going off
were legion, and he could never afterwards think of
the incident without a shudder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try and remember, Thad,&rdquo; said Step Hen,
meekly, for he was shivering now, because of the
narrow escape he and his chums had had.</p>
<p>Thad, on his part, carefully placed the dangerous
explosive in the crotch of a tree near by, where it
could do no harm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better bury it in the morning, to get rid
of it,&rdquo; he observed, as he sat down to examine the
odd looking assortment of little tools, for himself.</p>
<p>The others gathered around, curious to hear what
Thad&rsquo;s opinion might be; for they were used to
setting considerable store by his decisions on any
subject.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How d&rsquo;ye s&rsquo;pose now, Thad,&rdquo; remarked Giraffe,
to draw the other out, &ldquo;these fellers just came to
stop over here, in the identical place we chose for a
camp? That what&rsquo;s getting me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh that&rsquo;s easy,&rdquo; replied the other, with a little
laugh. &ldquo;We seemed to strike this place by
accident; but I reckon that if you asked Eli or Jim
here about it, they&rsquo;d be apt to tell you it&rsquo;s an old
camping spot. How about it, men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be&rsquo;n here often with parties,&rdquo; replied the older
guide, promptly. &ldquo;Seen hundreds o&rsquo; fine trout
jerked outen thet pool over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me tew,&rdquo; declared Jim, grinning broadly at finding
how smart this boy seemed to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are, Giraffe,&rdquo; Thad went on to say,
turning once more to the scout. &ldquo;Perhaps, as somebody
said only a little while back, this leader of the
sprinting yeggmen has himself been camping here
one or more times in the past, and he knows the
trails of the woods around here. Why, there&rsquo;s a
pretty good chance that Mr. Carson himself stopped
here over night, something like a week or less ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he didn&rsquo;t find that bag, nor his guides
either,&rdquo; remarked Step Hen, with a little show of
pride; as though he believed he ought to at least
have a small amount of credit for bringing the thing
to light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>&ldquo;For a good reason,&rdquo; Thad went on; &ldquo;because it
wasn&rsquo;t in the bushes when Mr. Carson came along
this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think, then, that the fellers who owned
these things must have been here after Mr. Carson
was, do you, Thad?&rdquo; Davy Jones asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a good notion that way,&rdquo; the scoutmaster
replied; &ldquo;and we&rsquo;re going to prove it, presently.
There are lots of ways to do that, you&rsquo;ll find; and if
Allan and I happen to fall down, why, we&rsquo;ll call on
Sebattis here to show us. Allan tells me that an
Indian can read signs just like you would print,
Davy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like to see him try it, then,&rdquo; muttered the scout,
casting a side glance toward the silent Penobscot
brave, who was sitting there watching them, and
never so much as opening his mouth, or betraying
any particular interest, though he must have heard
every word that had been spoken thus far.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After we&rsquo;ve had a hack at it, we may,&rdquo; Thad
admitted. &ldquo;You know Allan is up to some of
these things, and we ought to give him a show before
calling in outside talent; isn&rsquo;t that so, boys?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure it is,&rdquo; cried Bumpus; &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s my private
opinion, publicly expressed, that our comrade can
deliver the goods too. Give Allan a square deal.
Let him &lsquo;mosey&rsquo; around, and say what he thinks.
Then we&rsquo;ll ask the guides to prove it. That&rsquo;s the
ticket, fellers. An&rsquo; he can&rsquo;t begin any too soon to
satisfy my bump of curiosity. They do say at my
house I&rsquo;m a reg&rsquo;lar old woman for wantin&rsquo; to know;
and I must acknowledge the corn all right. Won&rsquo;t
you get busy, Allan, and relieve a sufferin&rsquo; public?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus appealed to, the Maine boy could not resist.
&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m not saying I can tell you all that
either of these guides might&mdash;not to mention Sebattis
here,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll do the best I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon that&rsquo;s about nigh all anybody can do,&rdquo;
observed Giraffe, also getting to his feet; for he was
more or less interested in any demonstration of
woodcraft that applied to Boy Scout knowledge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I know what the footprint of every
one of us looks like, even to our guides,&rdquo; began
Allan; &ldquo;because I&rsquo;ve made it my business to keep my
eyes around. And the first thing I&rsquo;m going to do is
to find out if there is any track here different from
ours. If I find that, I&rsquo;ll be pretty sure it was made
by others who camped here within the last night or
two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why do you say that?&rdquo; demanded Bumpus,
eagerly. &ldquo;What if Mr. Carson did stop here five,
six or even seven nights ago; you might run on
his track, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If I did, I&rsquo;d know it,&rdquo; replied Allan; &ldquo;not that
I&rsquo;ve even set eyes on the print of his hunting shoe
or boot, if he wears such, instead of moccasins; but
stop and remember, Bumpus we had a heavy rain
day before yesterday that must have passed over
this section as well as where we struck it. After
that it turned cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I forgot all about that,&rdquo; admitted the other
scout, looking foolish. &ldquo;Why, of course, that same
rain would have washed out the footprints of anybody
who had camped here as long ago as four or
five nights. That&rsquo;s right Allan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it didn&rsquo;t exactly wash the footprints out, it
would make them look faint; and a trailer would
soon know they were old. Now let me take a turn
around, and do the rest of you sit quiet here, till
I call out that I&rsquo;ve found something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took a blazing brand from the fire, and began
to move around the outskirts of the camp, beyond
the tents and the glow of the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why does he go so far away?&rdquo; asked Bumpus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because we&rsquo;ve been walking around here so
much that all chance of making any discovery would
be lost,&rdquo; replied Thad; &ldquo;and out there he may stand
a show. There, I can see him stoop down lower,
and I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if he&rsquo;d hit a footprint
right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others all craned their necks in order to see
what Allan was doing; and of course Giraffe had
them left far in the lurch when it came to this, on
account of his being gifted by a bountiful Nature
with such an exceedingly long ostrich like appendage
below his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s sure struck something,&rdquo; Giraffe declared,
as though anxious to show what an advantage
it was sometimes to be the possessor of a neck
that was longer than any of the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, he&rsquo;s beckoning to us to come on over,
fellers!&rdquo; exclaimed Bumpus, as he tried to leap to
his feet; but, owing to his weight, this was never
an easy thing for him, and he did not refuse the
helping hand Thad stretched out.</p>
<p>So they joined Allan, as he stood there, holding
his torch near the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you found?&rdquo; asked Giraffe, as they came
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a print, all right, that seems altogether
different from any of ours. I can show you that the
shoe has been patched across the toe, and none of
ours has such a mark. It&rsquo;s a fresh print too, and
that means the man who made it must have been here
since that rain storm. Is that clear enough for you,
boys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a cinch, that&rsquo;s what, Allan. Why, I&rsquo;m only
a tenderfoot scout, but I can understand that much.
And I&rsquo;m real glad to know it, too. We want to
take a good look at that shoe print, fellers; p&rsquo;raps
we might want to know it again sometime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Step Hen as he said this threw himself down on
the ground, and seemed to be making a mental
photograph of the impression.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How d&rsquo;ye reckon they got here, Allan; by boat,
or through the woods direct?&rdquo; asked Thad, as
though he had himself been pondering over that
question, without being able to connect, as yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take a look along the edge of the river,&rdquo;
remarked the Maine boy. &ldquo;If so be they had a
canoe, we ought to be able to see where it was
pulled up on the little beach down here. Such a
mark would stay a long time unless the water rose,
and I don&rsquo;t think that happened here, not over half
a foot, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So once more they walked after Allan, who was
soon examining the shore close to the edge of the
water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a mark you can all see, that looks as if
a boat had been pulled up, but it&rsquo;s old and faint.
The rain has nearly washed it out. Do any of you
glimpse signs of another scratch that&rsquo;s fresher?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allan&rsquo;s purpose, of course, was to make his
chums think they were having a hand in the search.
Then, when telling the story afterwards, they could
say &ldquo;when <i>we</i> had hunted all along the shore, and
didn&rsquo;t find any fresh sign, we knew that the yeggs
must sure have walked all the way through the
woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a little hustle as Giraffe, Davy, Step
Hen and Bumpus all endeavored to earn the right to
include themselves in the affair; after which they
united in declaring that no further signs lay along
the little beach.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve settled that part of it pretty
cleverly, I guess,&rdquo; Thad declared, as he smiled at
Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was one of the easiest jobs I ever tackled,&rdquo;
declared the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder which way they went when they left
here?&rdquo; Bumpus remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, just don&rsquo;t bother your head about that,
Bumpus,&rdquo; said Step Hen. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re letting your
envious mind think of that fat reward again; but
you&rsquo;d better forget it, Thad says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! if they were making toward the Canada
border,&rdquo; observed Allan, &ldquo;why, of course they
headed north after leaving here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so are we,&rdquo; was all Bumpus allowed himself
to say in reply; but the look he gave Step Hen
was sufficient to announce that he did not mean to
wholly relinquish all idea that somehow, some time,
they might yet run across the fugitives, and be able
to capture them handsomely.</p>
<p>The boys started back to the fire. Some of them
were even settled down close to the cheerful blaze,
warming themselves, and ready to talk some more
about the strange thing that had happened. Bumpus
was kicking his toe into the earth, as if some object
had attracted his attention. All at once he swooped
down, and then gave utterance to an excited ejaculation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looky at what I got, fellers!&rdquo; he exclaimed
hurrying up to the fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Money, real hard money!&rdquo; cried Step Hen,
enviously. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you dig that up, Bumpus?
Say, p&rsquo;raps there&rsquo;s more like it buried there. Mebbe
we&rsquo;ll strike a gold mine, and go home millionaires,
every one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For Bumpus was holding a bright new five dollar
gold piece in his hand, at which they all stared with
more or less delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw it shinin&rsquo; and gave a little kick at the
place, thinkin&rsquo; it might be a piece of glass, or some
old tin cut off a can. Then it broke loose from the
frozen dirt, and I saw this little beauty,&rdquo; Bumpus
was saying, in rapture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy money!&rdquo; grunted Giraffe, enviously; while
Step Hen darted over to see if he might not be as
lucky, though only to meet with bitter disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That seems to settle one thing, boys,&rdquo; remarked
Thad. &ldquo;Those rascals did rob a bank before they
took to the woods. And the stuff they got was so
heavy to carry, they just had to throw away their
tools here. That looks plain enough, don&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of them agreed that it did sound very much
that way. Indeed, Davy Jones remarked that he
considered them very sensible men, because he himself
would only too gladly get rid of some old steel
tools, if he had a chance to carry a bag of gold coins
along.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>Ten minutes later, as they were talking and laughing
there, never thinking how late the hour was
getting, and that they ought to be seeking their
blankets under the shelter of the two tents, Sebattis
was seen to quietly reach out his hand, and pick up
his gun, after which he slipped away.</p>
<p>The boys exchanged glances, but made no remark.
Another ten minutes passed by, when there
came a startling interruption to the peaceful quiet
of the camp. From some point near by a harsh
voice suddenly sounded, thrilling the scouts as they
could seldom remember being shaken:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throw up your hands, there, every one of you,
and see that you keep &rsquo;em raised, if you know what&rsquo;s
good for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And at the same moment three men issued from
the recesses of the woods, and advanced toward
them, all of whom held leveled guns in their hands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI.
<br /><span class="small">A SHERIFF&rsquo;S POSSE.</span></h2>
<p>Of course everybody did as they were told; and
when they afterwards exchanged opinions regarding
the ridiculous character of the picture they must
have made, with six boys and two men trying to see
who could elevate his hands the highest, they must
always laugh until the tears rolled down their
cheeks.</p>
<p>Somehow all of the scouts just took it for granted
that these three advancing parties must surely be
the men of whom they had been talking, the fleeing
desperate rascals who had lately robbed a bank, and
were trying to make the border so that they might
cross over into Canada, from which territory they
would be able to make faces at any pursuers.</p>
<p>But Thad, as he began to see the newcomers
better, when they drew nearer the fire, felt relieved.
An idea started to flit through his active brain, to
the effect that after all they might not be the thieves,
come back for some purpose, perhaps to recover
possession of the little, old, black tool-bag.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; called out the tall man who was in the
lead, and who seemed to be in authority, &ldquo;we know
you&rsquo;re tough cases, and we don&rsquo;t mean to give any
one of you a chance to play a game on us; so my
men will keep you all covered, while I go the rounds,
and put the irons on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; exclaimed Giraffe, his eyes looking as
round as saucers, when he heard this remark on the
part of the supposed terrible yeggman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please go a little slow about that, Mr. Sheriff!&rdquo;
called out Thad. &ldquo;If you look again, I&rsquo;m sure
you&rsquo;ll discover that six of us are only boys, and that
we belong to a troop of scouts. We&rsquo;re up here on
the track of a Mr. James W. Carson, who is in the
woods, with two guides. It is of great importance
that I find him, as I am bearing a communication
that means a heap to both Mr. Carson and my
guardian. As for these two men here, they are our
guides, Jim Hasty and Eli Crookes. I guess you
ought to know them both, sir. And there&rsquo;s another,
Sebattis, who is right behind you, gun in hand, ready
to hold you up if you try to do us any harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tall man whom Thad had rightly guessed to
be the sheriff in chase after the burglars who were
fleeing toward the border, gave another look, and
then burst into a loud shout.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one on us, all right, young fellow,&rdquo; he
remarked. &ldquo;We wondered why under the sun our
birds had started to hobnob with a crowd of Boy
Scouts; but you never can tell what&rsquo;s what, when
you&rsquo;re dealing with such sharp customers, and we
didn&rsquo;t mean to take any chances. It&rsquo;s all right, men,
you needn&rsquo;t handle those guns as if you meant to
shoot, any longer. These parties are all right. But
what I do want to know is, how came you by that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed as he spoke at the old tool-bag that
was lying beside Step Hen; and evidently he must
have recognized it, or else suspected what it contained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s mine&mdash;er, I mean to say I found the
same in the bushes here, when I was huntin&rsquo; something
I lost,&rdquo; and Step Hen held up a little packet
secured in waterproof cloth, which he had evidently
since discovered, just where he formerly laid it
down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We opened the bag, and guessed that the tools
must have been thrown away by some yeggmen who
were making a bolt across country for the Canada
border,&rdquo; remarked Thad, as the three officers sat
down close to the fire to warm their hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s just what&rsquo;s what,&rdquo; responded the
sheriff, nodding as he examined the contents of the
bag. &ldquo;We hope to get &rsquo;em in time, because it means
a cool thousand to us, perhaps more, because the reward
may have been doubled after we hit the woods.
Sometimes we&rsquo;ve been hot on the track, and then
again they&rsquo;d give us the slip, and we&rsquo;d lose ground.
I&rsquo;ve often wished we had dogs along; but they&rsquo;re
hard to find; and people, somehow, don&rsquo;t like to see
dogs up here, since the law put a ban on deer hounding.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to keep just one of them tools, to remember
my find by, if you didn&rsquo;t have any objection,&rdquo;
suggested Step Hen anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can keep the whole bunch if you like, son,&rdquo;
answered the sheriff; &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t need any such
evidence against these birds, if only we can ketch
&rsquo;em. They&rsquo;re carrying all the evidence we want,
in the shape of the entire capital of the bank they
looted so slick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose they broke open the safe in the usual
way, with dynamite?&rdquo; Thad remarked, quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what they did, though how you guessed it
I don&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; the sheriff replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We found something in the bag that told us
that,&rdquo; and Thad, as he spoke, stepped over to the
tree, in the crotch of which he had placed the stick
of dynamite.</p>
<p>Step Hen turned red in the face as he heard the
story told of how he had just been about to throw
the unknown substance into the fire when prevented.
The lengthy sheriff looked reproachfully toward
him, and remarked, mildly:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You want to go slow, my boy, about handling
things that you never saw before. I wouldn&rsquo;t like
to say what would have happened to the lot of you,
once this dropped into that red-hot fire. Many a
fool miner has been blown to atoms because he tried
to dry damp dynamite out in an oven, and let it get
too hot. Better ask yourself a few questions before
you go to trying tricks with strange things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you spend the night with us, Mr. Sheriff?&rdquo;
asked Thad, thinking that they ought to appear
hospitable, as every one who goes into the great
timber should be.</p>
<p>Besides, he rather fancied this Maine sheriff, and
believed that a session in his company alongside the
blazing camp-fire, would be both pleasant and profitable,
as doubtless the officer could relate many things
of interest to the scouts.</p>
<p>But the other shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, but when we&rsquo;re as close to the heels of
our game as this, we must keep on the move. It requires
considerable hustling to run down such a
lively set as those three yeggs. And Charley Barnes,
he know his business up here in the wood, all right.
They&rsquo;ve led us a lively chase up to now; but the
longer we&rsquo;re held off, the more determined we become
to follow them, night and day, till we bring the
lot to bay. They&rsquo;ve got mighty little grub along,
and we don&rsquo;t want to let &rsquo;em have any time to hunt.
Then perhaps hunger will help us out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if you&rsquo;re going on right away,&rdquo; said Allan,
&ldquo;perhaps you&rsquo;d let us make you some hot coffee,
Mr. Green?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>The sheriff looked keenly at him, and then held
out a hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seemed like thar was somethin&rsquo; kinder familiar
about your make-up,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;now I know you,
Allan Hollister. How&rsquo;s the dad, and the little lady
you call mother? I remember her well; and you too,
as a boy who loved to hunt and fish as well as any lad
in all Penobscot county.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father is dead, Mr. Green; but mother is
fairly well,&rdquo; replied the boy, with a sad tone to his
voice. &ldquo;We are not living in Maine any longer,
but down in New York state, where all these other
scouts belong. But will you drink that coffee, if we
make a pot for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sheriff saw that Allan did not seem inclined
to say anything more about his own family; and so
he allowed the subject to drop. But he did look
inquiringly at his two husky deputies, who gave him
affirmative as well as eager nods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just please yourselves, young fellows,&rdquo; he remarked.
&ldquo;My men look a bit peaked, because we&rsquo;ve
been hitting it up at quite a warm pace; and I guess
now, they&rsquo;d enjoy a hot cup right smart. I confess
I wouldn&rsquo;t object myself, seeing that you&rsquo;re so
pressing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>The coffee pot was quickly clapped on the red
coals, and would soon be sending out a fragrant
odor. Thad meanwhile stated to converse with the
officer, and by asking a few questions learned something
concerning the robbery, of which the three
fleeing tramp burglars had been guilty.</p>
<p>According to the sheriff, they were all hard characters,
and had served time in various jails, for
other crimes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If by chance you did run across the lot,&rdquo; he
observed; &ldquo;you&rsquo;d better look sharp, for they
wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate at anything, if they thought there
was any fear of being held up. Remember that,
boys, and govern yourselves accordingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which I take it,&rdquo; observed the listening
Bumpus, &ldquo;to mean, that we had ought to get them
covered first, if we run up against the crowd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what it does, and look out for tricks.
That Charley, he&rsquo;s as full of sly games as an egg is
of meat. H&rsquo;m! that does smell prime, son. What,
condensed milk along with you, too, and sugar. I
must say we struck a snap when we saw your fire
here, after heading for this old camp-ground. That
tastes like nectar, let me tell you: and warms a
fellow up inside better than any strong drink could
ever do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad you like it,&rdquo; said Thad; &ldquo;and we all of us
hope you come up with those three tramp burglars,
and gather them in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After drinking several cups of the coffee apiece,
the sheriff and his posse of two deputies declared
that they ought to be going.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a pretty good hunch as to where they
struck for after leaving here,&rdquo; remarked the officer,
as he shook hands all around, not forgetting the
silent Indian guide; &ldquo;and if they only stop over a
day, so&rsquo;s to get some game, why, we expect to surprise
them right smart. Good-bye, boys and good
luck. If so be we run across Mr. Carson, whom I
happen to know, why, we&rsquo;ll tell him you&rsquo;re on his
trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Waving his hand to them, the sheriff walked
quickly away, followed by his two men. And they
were heading due north the last the scouts saw of
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if they&rsquo;ll overtake that active bunch; or
will the yeggs get across the line as they&rsquo;re planning
to do?&rdquo; Giraffe ventured, as they sat there, talking
over this latest development in the affair, though one
or two of the scouts began to yawn every minute or
so, and rub their eyes, as though growing sleepy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody can tell,&rdquo; Thad remarked; &ldquo;but that
Sheriff Green bears all the earmarks of an officer
who generally get what he goes after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they say about him,&rdquo; Allan put in;
for he had not been talking with the rest; something
which the sheriff had said, possibly when asking
after his father, had caused the boy to think of
things that had happened in the past, which
apparently could not be apt to give him joy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>By degrees the scouts sought their blankets under
the canvas. Thad and Allan were the last to crawl
in. The guides had made themselves comfortable
near the fire, having blankets with them; and the
boys noticed how they all made sure to keep their
feet toward the blaze when selecting places for the
night. It was the woodsman&rsquo;s way, because the feet
are the first part of the body to feel cold, when, during
sleep, the blood fails to circulate as thoroughly
as when one is awake, since the heart slackens its
functions, in order to get rested for the next day&rsquo;s
labor.</p>
<p>Finally all was quiet. The night wind crooned
among the trees; an owl hooted to its mate; but
the scouts all slept calmly, with not a fear of
danger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII.
<br /><span class="small">THE BIRCH BARK CHALLENGE.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Eli says we&rsquo;re now in the big game country,
fellows!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe was rubbing at his gun when he made
this remark. They sat about a fire among the pines
that bordered the river; and another day had elapsed
since we last saw them in camp, at the time of the
visit made by the Maine sheriff, and his posse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds good to me,&rdquo; Step Hen observed.
&ldquo;Now, as for myself, I never claimed to be great
shakes at doing any hunting; but all the same, I feel
a longing to see a great moose standing up before
me while I proceed to bore him through and through
with my trusty rifle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe laughed scornfully as he continued to rub
away with a rag he had greased with vaseline.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You just take it from me, son, though I&rsquo;m not a
great woodsman myself, that if you ever do shoot
that popgun of yours at a full grown moose, the
quicker you shin up a good tree, the better. For
if you delay, he&rsquo;s going to help you with his horns.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Popgun, nothing,&rdquo; remonstrated Step Hen;
&ldquo;now, I&rsquo;d just like to know what you mean by
that? I took advice before I had my dad buy me
that gun. It was Allan here who told me the good
points about it. Just because you carry one of those
old-fashioned, big-bore rifles, that carry half a
pound of lead, more or less, you think a light
thirty-thirty gun is a plaything. But, my friend,
investigate, and you&rsquo;ll discover that it all lies in the
ammunition you use, not the bore of the gun. Ain&rsquo;t
that a fact, Thad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly is,&rdquo; replied the other; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll
prove it when I borrow that new repeating rifle of
yours, Step Hen, to try and bring down my moose&mdash;when
I get a chance to strike one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! don&rsquo;t see how you make that out,&rdquo;
grumbled Giraffe. &ldquo;This here gun is one of the
hardest hitters ever made. It is some hefty, I
admit; and in a long jaunt you&rsquo;d come off much
better than me, Step Hen. But what harm could
your little pea-shooter do against a big black bear,
or a savage moose, not to speak of a panther, or a
wolf?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looky here, and I&rsquo;ll show you, old scoffer,&rdquo; replied
Step Hen. &ldquo;Just take note of the cartridge
that goes in the magazine of my rifle. Do you see
how extra long it is, and how the powder chamber
swells much larger than the end that holds the
bullet? Well, the power is all there. But that ain&rsquo;t
all, not by a long sight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; said Giraffe, fretfully, as the other
paused, dramatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this is what they call a soft-nosed bullet.
They&rsquo;ve tried to prevent the use of them in war,
because they are so terrible in their results. When
it strikes even the flesh of a deer, it mushrooms out
till it makes a larger hole even than your big bore.
Yes, and if you asked Eli there, he&rsquo;d be likely to tell
you that if he <i>had</i> to choose between the two, he&rsquo;d
much prefer being hit by a bullet from your old elephant
gun, to one from my pea-shooter, as you call
it. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe listened, and frowned. He may have
tried to look as though he did not believe half he
heard; but apparently he had lost considerable interest
in his own heavy artillery, for he was seen to
quietly lay it down immediately afterwards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Sebattis has promised to show me how he
makes what he calls a &lsquo;moose-call&rsquo;,&rdquo; remarked
Bumpus, proudly; &ldquo;being a strip of birch bark,
curled up in a peculiar way like a long cornucopia;
and through this the hunter can coax an old bull to
come near enough to give him a shot. P&rsquo;raps now,
he&rsquo;ll even let us hear what it sounds like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bully!&rdquo; exclaimed Davy Jones; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always
wanted to know what that could be like, when I&rsquo;ve
read about men calling the moose. Does he come
to have a fight, Eli?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s jest what he does,&rdquo; replied the
older guide, who was smoking his pipe contentedly
by the fire, all duties for the day having been closed
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that must have been why Sebattis stripped
that bark from the birch tree after we landed this
afternoon,&rdquo; remarked Step Hen. &ldquo;I wondered
whether he meant to write on it, the way you told
us the Indians did, Allan; making pictures where
white men would have letters, and drawing the story
out. There he goes now, starting to make the horn,
I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is mighty pleasant up here, fellows,&rdquo; said
Thad, as he glanced around; &ldquo;all of you look perfectly
happy, as though not a single care rested on
your minds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpus immediately shivered, as though that reminded
him he ought to be ashamed of himself to
be enjoying such things, with heartless disregard
concerning the dreadful happenings that, for aught
he knew, were taking place at his home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he remarked, with a big sigh; &ldquo;I wonder
where they all are to-night. And I certainly hope
from the bottom of my heart, my poor father and
mother, and all my brothers and sisters ain&rsquo;t a-sittin&rsquo;
on the curb, without a place to sleep in. What
if that foolish forgetfulness was the cause of it all?
I&rsquo;ll never be happy again, boys, never once!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! there he goes again on that same old
racket!&rdquo; exclaimed Giraffe; who did not appear to
feel the slightest sympathy for his afflicted comrade,
simply, because he would not believe there could be
any reason for the dire forebodings of Bumpus.
&ldquo;Now, if we only had a wireless outfit along, and
Bumpus, here, could get in direct touch with his
folks, I reckon they&rsquo;d give him the merry laugh because
he&rsquo;s been so silly about that old letter. Why,
chances are, it wasn&rsquo;t anything much, after all.
Perhaps your dad wanted to ask his friend the
cashier of the bank to drop around that evening,
and have a game of billiards at your house. Do
please forget it; or anyway bury your troubles deep
down in your own bosom, Bumpus; because, if you
keep on frettin&rsquo; and moanin&rsquo; like you&rsquo;ve been doing,
the chances are you&rsquo;ll spoil this outing for the rest
of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked Bumpus, indignantly; &ldquo;guess
if you happened to be in the same fix that bothers
me, you&rsquo;d moan and groan too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;ve got troubles of my own, let me tell
you,&rdquo; continued Giraffe; &ldquo;all of us have. There&rsquo;s
Step Hen, he&rsquo;s wondering what we&rsquo;re going to have
to eat if we clean out all we fetched along, and the
game keeps some shy; Davy&rsquo;s been uneasy this long
time, ever since, in fact, he fell into the camp-fire
from the limb of a tree, where he was hangin&rsquo; by
his toes when the rotten thing broke under him;
Bumpus, you yourself are over your head in a sea
of troubles; or you were a short time back, when
you took that header over the end of the canoe, into
the river. We all have &rsquo;em, old fellow; but we don&rsquo;t
go around whinin&rsquo;, and tellin&rsquo; every one. Do close
up. There, looks like Sebattis is satisfied with the
shape of the horn he&rsquo;s made. Let&rsquo;s take a squint
at it, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The birch bark trumpet was passed around for
examination. No one knew better how to manufacture
the simple but effective moose call than the
Penobscot. Even such an old and experienced
guide as the Maine woodsman, Eli Crookes, was
ready to admit that Sebattis stood in a class all by
himself, when it came to enticing the wary but belligerent
moose to approach, by means of insidious
calls upon the crude horn, that breathed defiance
one minute, and enticing sounds the next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See if you can make it go,&rdquo; suggested Step Hen.</p>
<p>Accordingly Thad, who had it in his hands at
the time, placed it to his mouth. He puffed his
cheeks out, and Bumpus hastened to clap both hands
over his ears, as though he expected to hear a strident
blast, such as the old-time Highland chiefs were
accustomed to making when they wanted their clans
to appear, and attack the hated English from south
of the border.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>But it was wonderful what a miserably soft noise
followed all these efforts on the part of Thad. He
had never touched a moose call before, and did not
have the knack of extracting anything like a bellow
from the innocent-looking device.</p>
<p>There was a general laugh at his inability to make
use of the call; even the two Maine guides joining in,
though the result was nothing more nor less than
had been expected on their part. It requires long
practice to know just how to pucker up the lips, and
send the wind whistling through the bark tube that
becomes larger at the further end, until it resembles
a megaphone.</p>
<p>So Thad turned it over to Step Hen. That
worthy did his level best, and was only able to extract
a miserable squeak that made Bumpus chuckle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just try it yourself, and see,&rdquo; said Step Hen,
thrusting the call into the chubby hands of the stout
scout.</p>
<p>And so Bumpus, feeling confident that he could
at least excel the last attempt, since he was the
bugler of the troop, and could play on any sort of
instrument, took the call. He grew so red in the
face with trying to send forth a clarion note, that
some of the boys feared he would break a blood
vessel. But not even a grunt followed. The horn
refused to show any of it&rsquo;s good qualities, even when
a master hand at the bugle took hold.</p>
<p>Then Giraffe was induced to try, and with no
better success than had attended Step Hen&rsquo;s attempt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe the old thing can make a noise
at all!&rdquo; declared Bumpus, aggressively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you ask Sebattis to show you,&rdquo; suggested
Allan; who might have done it himself
fairly well, but did not wish to spoil the work of the
Indian.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the dark-faced guide, without showing
the slightest interest in the matter, took the roll
of birch bark, and placed it carelessly to his lips.
What the boys listened to then, was a revelation to
them. At first, the sound seemed like several troubled
grunts, and Bumpus was grinning with the expectation
that it was going to prove to be a rank
failure, when the call grew louder and more insistent,
until it seemed to roll up against the mountain
far away on the other side of the river like a burst
of thunder; or in great waves of sound. Then it
grew softer again, and finally wound up with another
tremendous volume that seemed to make the
very air vibrate.</p>
<p>After Sebattis took the call down from his lips
the echoes swung back and forth from one side of
the river to the other, gradually dying away in the
far distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My! but that was simply great!&rdquo; ejaculated the
entranced Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never heard anything to equal it in all my life;
and such a queer whoop too!&rdquo; declared Giraffe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look at Sebattis; what&rsquo;s he sitting up that way
for?&rdquo; cried Davy Jones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to be listening, fellers! Oh! I wonder
what he&rsquo;s heard? Is that an echo that comes stealing
back from up-river way?&rdquo; and Bumpus half
started to clamber to his feet.</p>
<p>Then the six scouts remained motionless, as,
with their ears on the alert for the faintest sounds,
they heard an increasing answering call come stealing
through the night air.</p>
<p>Thad reached out his hand toward where Step
Hen had rested his new magazine rifle against a
neighboring tree. He guessed instantly what it
meant. There was no echo about that thrilling
sound! Sebattis had sent out a challenge, and it
must have reached the ears of a real bull moose that
chanced to be within hearing; and this swelling
roar that they were listening to now was his sturdy
response.</p>
<p>Yes, it was surely a genuine moose that had answered
the call; and no doubt he was even at that
very minute lumbering along over the pine-covered
slope, eager to accept the challenge that breathed in
that strange medley of sounds!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><span class="small">OUT FOR BIG GAME.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! so that&rsquo;s a moose, is it?&rdquo; gasped
Giraffe, being the first to break the tense silence that
had fallen upon the campers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a queer old sound,&rdquo; almost whispered
Bumpus. &ldquo;My stars! but I guess he&rsquo;s most as big
as our old red barn at home. Is he heading this way,
Sebattis, Eli, Jim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpus cast a despairing look around him while
saying this. Thad had an idea he must be trying
to pick out a desirable tree which he could &ldquo;shinny
up&rdquo; in case the moose raided the camp; for owing
to his build Bumpus was not so good at climbing as
some others, Giraffe or Davy Jones for instance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just now that&rsquo;s what the ole duffer, he&rsquo;s
a-doin&rsquo;,&rdquo; replied Eli; while the Indian guide only
nodded his head, being a man of few words usually.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to tackle him?&rdquo; demanded Step
Hen. &ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t you fellers all look at <i>me</i>, just
because I said that little rifle of mine was good for
any animal that walked these here Maine woods. I
gave up first chance to Thad long ago, didn&rsquo;t I,
Thad? You see, a feller that hasn&rsquo;t had great experience
at such things don&rsquo;t want to rush in too
fast. I promised my maw to be careful, and I mean
to. As for me, you see, I said that Thad had to try
out my new gun. The man in the store told me not
to think of standing up before any big game till I&rsquo;d
practiced how to use the pump part. You see, if a
feller got rattled, and needed to send in a second
shot, he might try to work the thing wrong, get it
stuck, and then have a fine old time. So Thad for
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So say we all of us,&rdquo; remarked Giraffe. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d
like to see what Thad could do. He hasn&rsquo;t never
had a chance at a moose. You go with Sebattis,
Thad. The rest of us&rsquo;ll sit by the fire here, and
wait for things to happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No fire,&rdquo; remarked Sebattis. &ldquo;Eli put um out.
You come &rsquo;long with me, Tad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somehow the Indian could never get the hang of
Thad&rsquo;s name, and called him Tad; but it was rather
a curiosity to hear him talk at all, so nobody ever
objected, least of all the patrol leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is mighty fine of you boys,&rdquo; whispered
Thad, as he watched Eli and Jim proceeding to
scatter the fire, and trample on the embers; in which
task the other members of the party only too willingly
assisted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>In a minute, almost, they were in darkness under
the pines. Meanwhile Sebattis had baited the
moose with another of his wonderful calls, thrilling
the lads just as much as on the first occasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh! make me shiver,&rdquo; muttered Bumpus.
&ldquo;Seems like there just must be a great big critter,
with horns ten feet high, ready to rush the camp.
Hey! don&rsquo;t get away from me, Jim; I want to squat
alongside in the dark. After all that light it seems
rough to be left in the gloom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mustn&rsquo;t talk no more, or sneeze, or cough!
Skeer moose right bad,&rdquo; whispered the younger
guide, as he threw an arm across the fat shoulders
of Bumpus, for whom he seemed to have taken an
especial fancy.</p>
<p>And so the balance of the campers crouched there,
with every nerve on edge, listening eagerly for the
slightest sound, which of course was magnified a
dozen fold, owing to the tension under which they
were laboring.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Thad had followed after the Indian
guide.</p>
<p>His very first act, before the light of the fire was
extinguished, had been to hastily examine the small-bore
repeating rifle which belonged to Step Hen,
and which the owner was so anxious to have Thad
christen with the first shot, at game worth while.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>It seemed to be in splendid working order, and
Thad believed he could depend on it to do the work,
providing he aimed straight. There is a vast amount
of result depending on the man behind the gun,
whether in war, or in hunting.</p>
<p>At first it seemed pitch dark to the boy, as he
kept close at the heels of the Penobscot Indian.
That was partly because his eyes had been blinded
from sitting there, looking into the heart of the blazing
camp-fire so long. Now that this did not happen
to be the case any longer, he found that he could
gradually see better; until presently the dim form
of Sebattis began to make itself noticeable just in
front.</p>
<p>How silently the Indian moved along. Thad
wondered whether this came from the fact of his
wearing elkskin moccasins, or because he had been
raised never to make a noise when passing through
the woods; perhaps it was both; but Thad wished he
could only emulate his example; and then and there
he determined to possess himself of the soft-soled
hunting boots of the same type as those of Sebattis,
at the first opportunity.</p>
<p>He knew from the confidence with which the
guide was advancing through the darkness that he
must have immediately settled in his mind just
where they should lie in wait for the bull moose.</p>
<p>And it struck Thad right then and there that the
dark-faced guide was about as good a pattern for a
Boy Scout to follow, as any one whom he could
imagine. Surely Sebattis kept his eyes constantly
on the alert; and never could be caught napping.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>For instance, look at the way he lifted his head
to listen some ten minutes before the sheriff arrived
upon the scene, and gave the boys that rude jolt
when he called out to them to surrender. Sebattis
must have heard some slight sound that warned him
of the stealthy approach of either human beings or
game, and he had crept out of camp so as to be in
a position to hold the upper hand, in case of any
necessity.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was a little strange how all these
thoughts crowded through the mind of Thad, as he
was following silently as possible at the very heels
of the guide.</p>
<p>Other things trooped through that active brain of
his, too; for Thad had schooled himself to see and
notice everything he could. For instance, he became
aware of the fact that they were heading almost
directly up into the wind. That in itself was
nothing surprising, for a true still hunter always
looks to have the air blowing from the game toward
himself, as in that way he prevents the keen-scented
animal from getting notice of his approach, and
fleeing before he can find a chance to send in a shot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>Yes, the night breeze was coming out of the
north, and the moose was approaching from the
same quarter. The last time they heard his echoing
challenge it seemed much closer than ever, showing
that the bull was advancing with little rushes.
He would push on for a couple of minutes, and then
halt to send out a call, and listen. Then Sebattis
would proceed to lure him on with the most seductive
calls he could extract from his wonderful birch
bark horn.</p>
<p>So it went on, the two parties approaching one
another at a speed which promised a meeting very
shortly.</p>
<p>Thad felt his heart beating almost twice as fast
as ordinarily. He did not like this, and sternly resolved
to control his nerves. The party who expects
to shoot big game must be able to aim straight,
and keep his wits about him, so as to send in a second
and a third shot, should they be needed; else he
may find that the boot is on the other foot, and that
it is he himself who is being hunted.</p>
<p>Fighting down this nervousness as best he could,
the boy set his teeth firmly together, and was resolved
to do all in his power to justify the confidence
his comrades seemed to have in his ability to
&ldquo;do the troop proud,&rdquo; as Giraffe would have said.</p>
<p>Another thing he noticed by this time. They did
not seem to be trying to get to higher ground at all,
as he had expected would be the case. On the contrary,
Sebattis was following the upward trend of
the river. Perhaps he only wanted to move as far
away from the camp as possible, so that the suspicious
animal might not get a whiff of air that, to
him, might bear some sign of the extinguished fire;
or detect uneasy movements among the scouts left
behind, and who could not keep just as still as they
should.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>But somehow Thad had an idea there might be
yet another reason for their keeping on in this direction,
as if meaning to intercept the coming bull
moose; and presently he found it out for a fact.</p>
<p>Once, twice, three times had the guide stopped to
send out that strange sound that went reverberating
down the river, until it died away in mournful
cadence in the distance.</p>
<p>Then he came to a sudden stop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here do, Tad; you drop down this way.
Keep eye on top ridge up there. See um moose
stand out &rsquo;gainst sky. Try hit back shoulder. No
get, p&rsquo;raps me shoot too. How that suit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was more than Thad had ever heard Sebattis
say in one breath since meeting the Old-town
guide. But he instantly saw what the other meant,
for Thad had the instincts of a born hunter in him.</p>
<p>From the spot where they knelt, by looking up
just a little, they could see the bald top of a low-lying
ridge close at hand, where it was outlined
sharply against the star jeweled sky. Any bulky
object as big as a cow, or even a wolf, would, if
standing there on the ridge, be plainly shown
against the heavens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand, Sebattis,&rdquo; the boy whispered
back; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll try to do you credit. Tell me when
to shoot, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>Then the two relapsed into silence. The last defiant
call of the coming moose was just dying out.
It had been fearfully close, and Thad knew that the
animal must be less than a quarter of a mile away
from them at the time he stood still to give that
call.</p>
<p>Sebattis answered it, and Thad began to notice
that he no longer sent out that vociferous challenge
as before. He believed that the guide must now be
imitating the voice of the moose cow, to tempt the
other bull on so as to fight for the possession of a
mate, which he doubtless lacked.</p>
<p>A few more minutes passed away. Thad imagined
he could actually hear his heart pounding
away within its prison, so loudly did it throb. He
began to fear that after that last challenge the bull
had become suspicious, and declined to advance any
closer. But apparently the guide did not share in
his apprehensions; for he continued to make those
lower sounds, as though wheedling the other into
coming on, and entering the lists with the bull who
already had a mate.</p>
<p>Still there was no answering blast. What could
it mean?</p>
<p>Thad was beginning to have a feeling of bitter
disappointment and chagrin, when all at once he
heard something that gave him an electric shock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>It was like the crackling of branches, or the
breaking of dead bushes under the impact of a
ponderous body. Thad knew now that the guide
had not been mistaken with regard to his ability to
coax the suspicious old bull to close quarters; for
the moose was even then climbing the other side of
the low ridge, and must appear in sight on the summit
at any moment!</p>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX.
<br /><span class="small">&ldquo;GOOD SHOT! GREAT LITTLE GUN!&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>Strangely enough, Thad discovered at the same
time that his nerves had suddenly become as rigid as
though he were simply about to fire at a mark, to
try the new rifle belonging to Step Hen.</p>
<p>This is one of the tests of a born hunter. He
may feel nervous up to the critical moment, when
he stiffens, and seems to be made of steel.</p>
<p>Thad believed that he was in condition to do himself
justice when the proper time came to shoot.
The distance was short, and although he would
have preferred having a different kind of light than
merely seeing a black object lined up against the
sky, still he was familiar with guns, and could, if
necessary, aim merely through instinct.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>The floundering grew in volume. Evidently the
bull was having some difficulty in pushing upward
through the bushes that covered the other side of
the little ridge, the existence of which Sebattis must
have known before, or he would never have headed
this way so confidently.</p>
<p>But the animal was certainly coming on, for the
sounds grew louder all the while. And whenever
he seemed to stop, from any cause, there was always
that same tempting, wheedling sound to draw
him on again.</p>
<p>It was a minute that the scout would never forget,
since this was really his first attempt to bring
down game of any great size.</p>
<p>Again there came a silence. Was the bull hesitating
again? Somehow Sebattis had toned down
his notes to a low murmur; but it was intended to
be very enticing to the stranger.</p>
<p>And all at once Thad felt the hand of the guide
touch his arm. He guessed that this must be meant
as a signal to draw his attention to the fact that
there was at last something doing above; and at the
same instant the boy detected a moving object come
into view over the top of the bald ridge.</p>
<p>Higher it rose until he no longer had any doubt
that he was looking at the towering horns of a giant
moose bull.</p>
<p>And in another moment the whole bulk of the
beast was outlined against the starry heavens.</p>
<p>The critical time was at hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>Sebattis no longer played upon his birch bark
horn. He had dropped it to the ground, and doubtless
gripped his old rifle so as to be ready to pour in
a second shot, should his boy-companion fail to send
his lead where it would strike a death blow. For
Sebattis remembered that after all Thad was a lad
who had never before looked upon one of these
greatest of all American game animals on his native
heath and that perhaps the sight might rattle
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was only the faintest of whispers, but Thad
caught it, for the mouth of the Indian guide was
just a short distance away from his ear.</p>
<p>He had already lowered his cheek to the stock of
the little rifle, and his finger was touching the trigger.
Almost through instinct, such as comes to one
who has the blood of a hunter flowing through his
veins, the boy judged where he must aim, for such
a thing as actually seeing the shoulder of the gloomy
figure was just then impossible.</p>
<p>The sight of that grand animal standing there
with upraised head, listening eagerly for the faintest
indication of the presence of those whose calls had
tempted him to make this pilgrimage, was one Thad
would never be able to wholly get out of his mind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>Then he pressed the trigger of his rifle, and its
quick response to the invitation came as a pleasure
to his ears. Hardly had he fired than Thad was
working the mechanism that was intended to throw
out the empty shell, and send another fresh cartridge
into the firing chamber; and it spoke well for his
ability to do the right thing when he accomplished
all this without the slightest hitch; so that in two
seconds he was ready to send in a second shot if
needed.</p>
<p>Sebattis had not fired.</p>
<p>This was really the first thing that flashed into
Thad&rsquo;s mind, and gave him sudden hope. The second
was that even though he himself had wanted to
shoot again, there was no chance, for the moose had
disappeared.</p>
<p>He expected to hear that crashing of the bushes
again, telling how the wounded animal, for he knew
he must have hit the moose, was rushing away as
fast as he had come. But he failed to catch it.</p>
<p>On the contrary, different sounds came to his ear,
which he could not understand for the moment. It
even seemed to him that the brave moose might have
really met with an enemy, and was fighting gallantly
against heavy odds.</p>
<p>Well, that was just what must be happening; and
the foe was one that every moose must sooner or
later find himself grappling with; for it was the grim
reaper, death.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>Sebattis, with that wonderful instinct of his, had
known instantly from certain actions of the moose
upon being struck, that the animal had received his
death wound. He understood that there was really
no need of his sending in a second shot; and besides,
he preferred that the young Nimrod should have
the full credit of slaying the big bull.</p>
<p>Sebattis, for all he was an Indian, had all the
generosity that marks the true sportsman; and later
on, in thinking it over, Thad realized how much he
was indebted to the guide for refraining from firing
after he had done so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You get um, Tad!&rdquo; exclaimed the Indian, with
a touch of pride in his tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! do you really think I did, Sebattis?&rdquo; cried
the delighted young hunter, now trembling like an
aspen leaf, for the crisis was all past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me; see!&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>Eagerly did Thad climb that little slope. It was
now all as silent as death up yonder. He hoped
after all, Sebattis might not be mistaken, and that
the wily old moose, although severely hurt, had
managed to slip away. They would surely never be
able to track him by the drops of blood he shed.</p>
<p>But now they were on top of the rise. Thad had
brought along with him the little electric torch
which he had purchased before starting on this trip
to Maine. All he had to do was to grip it in his left
hand, press a button, and instantly a brilliant ray of
light shot out of the end. With this he could see
objects as much as sixty or eighty feet away, and
plainly at half that distance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>So now he flashed this light ahead. At first he
failed to discover anything on the ground, and his
heart seemed to rise in his throat with cruel disappointment
at the thought that after all he had
missed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tad, see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the Indian who was plucking at his sleeve,
and directing his attention over to the left. And as
the boy quickly turned the light in that direction he
was thrilled to discover the moose lying there on his
side, and not moving in the slightest degree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I did get him, didn&rsquo;t I, Sebattis?&rdquo; he cried,
delighted beyond measure at his good fortune; for it
is not every hunter who can say he brought down
the first big game at which he has fired.</p>
<p>The guide was bending over the fallen monarch
of the Maine woods. His first inclination was to see
where the fatal bullet had struck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mighty good shot. Great little gun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at Step Hen&rsquo;s up-to-date thirty-thirty
calibre rifle as though after this he must be a fool to
go packing his own heavy tool through woods, and
over carries, when one-half the weight would do better
work.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>And he even thrust his finger into the ragged hole
just back of the fore leg of the dead animal, as
though wondering how so small a bullet could ever
make such a big opening. Sebattis had something to
learn concerning the results springing from the use
of a soft-nosed bullet, that flattens out when striking
any object, even the side of an animal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to let the boys know right away,&rdquo; said
Thad, thinking of how his chums must be almost
consumed with anxiety to be told the result of that
lone shot; which Step Hen must guess came from
his new rifle, and not the larger one carried by the
Indian guide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tad call um here. Me make little fire, so see
how climb hill,&rdquo; said Sebattis.</p>
<p>Only too gladly did Thad send out a whoop that
easily reached the listening ears of those comrades in
camp. An answering hail came back.</p>
<p><a href="#front" id="rfront">&ldquo;Did you get him, Thad?</a>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on over here, all of you,&rdquo; was all Thad
would say in return.</p>
<p>Immediately they heard a great threshing, as the
entire crowd started on a run in the direction of the
call. Doubtless poor Bumpus would have fared
badly, and been left far in the lurch, only for the
kindness of Jim, who gave him a helping hand over
all obstacles.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Indian had hastened to scrape together
a few handfuls of dead stuff, which he
seemed to know just where to look for; to this he
applied a match and as it sprang into a tiny flame,
he proceeded to add such fuel as he could most
readily pick up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>In less than a minute he had a real fire going, that
began to dispel the shadows of night around the
vicinity of the spot where the giant moose lay. As
it burned on the top of the bald ridge, the fire would
serve as a beacon to show the others just how to
reach the place.</p>
<p>Now they were climbing the low elevation. Thad
could hear some of them puffing at a great rate. Of
course Giraffe was the first to arrive, with Eli close
on his heels; then Allan, and the others trailing
after in any old style.</p>
<p>Each one of them pushed immediately to where
the prize lay; and loud were the exclamations of
astonishment when they realized just what a monster
it was that Thad had brought down with that
one fortunate shot.</p>
<p>Step Hen in particular was almost crazy with joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now make fun of my pea-shooter, will you,
Giraffe?&rdquo; he cried, dancing around, and hugging
his fine little rifle with all the delight a boy might
show in the possession of his first long trousers.
&ldquo;Just look at what it did, would you? Why, anybody&rsquo;s
just silly to lug an old heavy blunderbuss
like yours around, when he c&rsquo;n own such a bully
little thing at this. Oh! didn&rsquo;t she just do everything
to that old bull, though? If he&rsquo;d known about my
gun he&rsquo;d have lit out in the other direction, licketty-split.
After this, why should I be afraid to stand
up in front of any sort of big game that walks on
four feet or hoofs? You hear me, Giraffe?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>Thad did not disturb the wild dream of the tenderfoot
chum; though he wondered whether Step Hen
could have hit Bumpus&rsquo; old red barn, if, lying there
in wait, he had suddenly seen the monster rise into
view above the crown of the low ridge, and felt Sebattis
nudge him in the ribs, as a warning that the
time had come to shoot.</p>
<p>But it was a great moment for all the scouts, as
they stood over the prize that had fallen to the gun
of their patrol leader, Thad Brewster.</p>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X.
<br /><span class="small">THE OLD TRAPPER&rsquo;S CABIN.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;re we goin&rsquo; to get this game all the way to
camp?&rdquo; demanded Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Camp?&rdquo; echoed Davy Jones, beginning to look
alarmed, as he contemplated the enormous bulk of
the bull moose, and then imagined the lot of them
tugging and straining every nerve to drag it over
the intervening ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, just you hold on, there, Davy; don&rsquo;t begin
to feel one of them cramp fits of your comin&rsquo; on,
just because we have to work like pack horses,&rdquo;
Step Hen remarked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t never thinking of such a thing,&rdquo; said
Davy, stiffening up again. &ldquo;You just think it&rsquo;s
funny, but if ever you got doubled up once, you&rsquo;d
feel for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In times past the Jones boy had been subject to
queer fits that took him all of a sudden, and doubled
him up with a severe cramp. When he had one of
these, he was utterly helpless. They had saved Davy
more than a few whippings, in school and at home:
and in this respect proved very accommodating
cramps. But latterly the boys suspected Davy had
really outgrown them; and that he was only threatened
with a return of the disease whenever there
seemed to be some hard work to be done. Possibly
his active outdoor life, and that gymnastic desire on
his part to do all manner of athletic stunts had
helped get rid of the trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But after all,&rdquo; declared Thad, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think
anybody is dreaming of trying to carry, or drag the
moose all the way to our camp. How about that,
Eli?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The older guide, upon being appealed to in this
fashion, remarked that they would be foolish to
think of such a thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We kin cut it up right here in the mornin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he
observed. &ldquo;I guess yu boys&rsquo;d like to try a steak
from the ole bull; an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll tote sum o&rsquo; the meat
along. An&rsquo; as fur the horns, I kin fix them all
right. We&rsquo;ll kerry &rsquo;em in one of the canoes, so&rsquo;s ye
kin show yer friends the kind o&rsquo; game we has up
here in Maine.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>That suited Thad just right. He wanted those
towering horns very much, and was only afraid
there might be some objection to taking them along,
for they must weigh quite heavily.</p>
<p>So after a while the whole party started back to
the camp, where a fire was once more kindled, the
night being cool, the guides felt the need of warmth,
since they would have no cover over them as they
slept.</p>
<p>It was some time before the scouts could think of
settling down. The glorious success that had attended
this first try at game worth while, seemed
to inspire the entire lot with an eager desire to
emulate Thad&rsquo;s example. Why, even Bumpus
seemed to partake of the fever to some extent,
though he had brought no gun along, and did not
claim to be any sort of sportsman.</p>
<p>When morning came at last the oldest guide went
over, and started operations on the dead moose.
He took off the skin, and secured the horns for the
successful hunter, to be preserved as a trophy of the
event.</p>
<p>Besides this, Eli brought back quite a lot of the
best meat. The boys were wild to see what moose
steak tasted like; but although it aroused their hunger
while it was in process of cooking, still the best
any of them could do was to gnaw at their portion,
for it was as tough as anything they had ever
struck.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where we missed it,&rdquo; grumbled Giraffe,
after giving up in disgust all efforts to masticate
some of his portion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what way do you mean?&rdquo; asked Thad, expecting
the other would say he ought to have selected
a younger and more tender animal, when supplying
food for the camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; the tall scout continued, with a broad
grin; &ldquo;d&rsquo;ye know, I said we had ought to fetch
that little meat chopper our folks at home use; and
the rest of you laughed at the idea. Just think, if
we had it now, what a fine hash we&rsquo;d be enjoyin&rsquo;
every day. That&rsquo;s the only thing I know of that
could grind up this tough meat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was rather later than usual that morning before
they got started in the canoes; there seemed so
much to do. But in good time these various duties
were fulfilled. The guides did not appear at all
anxious. They seemed to feel satisfied that before
a great while had passed, they would get in touch
with the party they were following; and meant that
the boys in their charge should enjoy some of the
Maine hunting on the way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>Eli declared that he knew of another fine camping
spot ahead, which they would doubtless reach about
dark. This was really an old and long deserted
cabin, once occupied by a trapper, who had taken
his toll of furs in the neighboring streams where
once upon a time all manner of valuable animals
were plentiful, from mink, otter, marten, and even
beaver; while around the vicinity foxes used to be
thick, not to mention wildcats, an occasional panther,
and even wolves; though these latter can seldom
be found within the limits of Maine at the
present day.</p>
<p>The boys had had more or less experience in using
log cabins for nights lodgings; and they amused
themselves as they pushed on, with reminiscences of
events that would always be interesting to them.</p>
<p>Of course there were times when the three canoes
were some little distance apart, but again they would
come close enough together for the inmates to have
shaken hands, had the inclination to do so arisen.</p>
<p>At noon they stopped to eat lunch, and give the
guides a chance to rest, for the work of pushing up
against that current was no child&rsquo;s play. Although
the boys were ready to lend a helping hand, and
&ldquo;spell&rdquo; the guides from time to time, naturally the
brunt of the work fell on Eli, Jim and Sebattis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did any of you hear a gunshot a little while
ago?&rdquo; asked Giraffe, when the boats came together
about the middle of the afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He keeps on sayin&rsquo; he&rsquo;s sure he did,&rdquo; broke in
Bumpus, who was in the canoe with the tall boy,
making &ldquo;the long and short of it, or both extremes
meet,&rdquo; as Bumpus himself often humorously remarked;
&ldquo;but neither Eli nor I caught it. How
about the rest of you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing doing here,&rdquo; said Step Hen; and all
the rest, even the stolid Sebattis, denied having
heard anything that sounded like the report of a
firearm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which way did it seem to come from, Giraffe?&rdquo;
asked Thad, wondering if after all the other could
have caught a faint sound that escaped the vigilance
of the three guides; and thinking of Mr. Carson, of
course, who was ahead somewhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! about the way we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; I reckon,&rdquo; replied
Giraffe. &ldquo;Just seemed to ketch the faintest
little boom; but Eli said as how he hadn&rsquo;t heard
nothin&rsquo;. The wind had died out at the time, but the
air was still from the north. I&rsquo;m right sure it was
a gun, even if Bumpus here does say I had an idea,
and it was such a new thing it hit me with a bump.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The afternoon wore away, and the sun set without
their having reached their destination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your old and comfy cabin?&rdquo; demanded
Bumpus. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of sittin&rsquo; here so long,
and I guess I&rsquo;ll never be able to get straightened
out again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; grunted Giraffe, &ldquo;think of me, will
you? Ain&rsquo;t I near twice as long? Ain&rsquo;t I twisted
up in a knot every which way? My legs took to
bendin&rsquo; so they&rsquo;ll knock my knees together; or else
look like hoops. How much you got to complain
about, you little dumplin&rsquo;, Bumpus.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But Eli says we&rsquo;re going on, and that we&rsquo;ll
make it not a great while after dark sets in,&rdquo;
Bumpus remarked, scorning to enter into an argument
with the other on the subject of whether it
paid to be long drawn out, or else shut up in a
small compass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for Eli, then; we can&rsquo;t get there any too
soon to suit me,&rdquo; declared Davy Jones, who was
working a paddle in conjunction with Jim; Allan
having done more than his share of the work during
various periods in the afternoon just passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give us half a hour more, and we&rsquo;ll sure git
thar,&rdquo; said Eli, later on, when the shadows of coming
night began to cover the river; and had already
swooped down in full force upon the adjacent
woods.</p>
<p>They paddled along in silence, except when one
of the boys managed to splash in dipping or removing
his paddle blade. Those who were new to the
work found that they had considerable to learn before
they could expect to work as silently as Sebattis,
for example. The way the Indian would
sent the canoe forward with vigorous thrusts, and
yet never removing his paddle from the water, and
making no sound whatever, was a never ending
source of delight to both Thad and Step Hen. And
the latter tried valiantly to imitate his example
whenever he took the extra spruce blade in hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>Finally, when the half hour had about arrived at
its conclusion, Eli gave the tired voyagers a pleasant
shock by suddenly calling out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Land here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three canoes were enabled to find good places
to run ashore, by means of Thad&rsquo;s precious little
electric torch, which came in handy in scores of different
ways during the Maine expedition, and paid
for itself time and again.</p>
<p>Then, first of all, they found where the cabin lay.
Eli seemed to know all about it, and claimed to have
spent many a night under the shelter of its still
fairly well preserved roof; though it had been two
years now since last he was here; for on the previous
season he took a party along another trail.</p>
<p>Giraffe insisted on starting a little blaze outside.
He was always thinking of some excuse for making
fires; and in this instance nobody quarreled with
him, for they really needed some light in order to
unload the canoes, and carry the stuff up to the old
cabin.</p>
<p>The door would not go more than half-way shut,
but outside of this defect, which was not so very
serious, since the wintry blasts had not yet set in,
the log cabin seemed to offer a cozy shelter for the
night.</p>
<p>Once they got inside, and Giraffe was set to work
again, building another fire, this time in the big fireplace,
above which yawned the wide-throated chimney.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>The cabin had once been quite a pretentious place,
in those old days when the builder, perhaps with a
trapper pard, spent his time here gathering a heavy
tribute of rich pelts from the native furry inhabitants
of swamp and river and forest.</p>
<p>Its roof was quite high, and the reason for this
became manifest as soon as any one entered; for
it was found that there was a loft extending halfway
across, and which could be reached by a rude
but still sturdy ladder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, what in the dickens do you think he ever
built that up there for?&rdquo; Step Hen said, as he
started to ascend the ladder; and then, thinking
better of it, gave up the idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A place to store his bales of dried furs, so Eli
says,&rdquo; replied Allan. &ldquo;You see, being up here for
six months, constantly gathering in new pelts every
day, they increased rapidly, and took considerable
space; so, having plenty of room, he just ran that
platform half-way across, and six feet and a half
from the floor down here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great stunt,&rdquo; remarked Step Hen, but he made
no further attempt to ascend to the platform, his
curiosity being satisfied.</p>
<p>And later on, Step Hen shook hands with himself
because of that second thought, considering himself
a lucky boy, which indeed proved to be the case.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>There was more or less talking and laughing as
they started preparations for supper. The chimney
seemed to draw poorly at first, possibly on account
of not having been used for so long. When it got
warmed up, perhaps it would &ldquo;behave&rdquo;, Eli remarked.
Meanwhile there was considerable smoke
in the cabin, and more or less sneezing, as well as
rubbing of smarting eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, what d&rsquo;ye mean, trying to choke us all,
Giraffe?&rdquo; demanded Bumpus, who looked as though
in great distress, as the tears were rolling down his
fat cheeks like &ldquo;little Niagaras&rdquo;, Step Hen declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I reckon, now, you just picked out the
greenest wood ever, so&rsquo;s to give us a good dose of
this?&rdquo; suggested Davy Jones, also rubbing his eyes.</p>
<p>Altogether the boys were making so much noise
themselves that no one could expect to hear anything
else. That was the only reason Thad could
give, later on, why the keen ears of Eli or Sebattis
had not detected certain things that must have come
to their knowledge had it not been for this clamor,
and rattle of merry tongues.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody think of having some more of that
india-rubber steak for supper?&rdquo; sang out Giraffe,
still working with the fire, which seemed to be behaving
a little better already, and gave promise of
being all right presently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, don&rsquo;t everybody shout out at once. Put
me down for baked beans first, last and all the
time,&rdquo; declared Bumpus, seeking the vicinity of the
door in order to cool his heated eyes, smarting from
the pungent smoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! who&rsquo;s rocking the old cabin like that?
Let up, can&rsquo;t you before it goes over?&rdquo; shouted
Step Hen, standing in the doorway for air.</p>
<p>Possibly he may have thought it did go over, for
just then some great hairy object came tumbling
down from the loft, making some use of the ladder,
but at the same time landing with a crash on the
floor. Then, before any one could so much as make
the first move toward one of the guns, standing in
a corner of the cabin, this lumbering object hustled
over to the half-open door, and bowled through, upsetting
both Step Hen and Bumpus in its passage.</p>
<p>For a second or two silence followed, and then a
tremendous shout broke out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great smoke! did you see it?&rdquo; whooped
Giraffe, jumping to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who hit me?&rdquo; gurgled Bumpus, who had
crashed into the wall of the cabin, and was sitting
there on the floor, looking dazed.</p>
<p>A head was thrust in through the half-open door,
and Step Hen shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a great big black bear, and he just went
and kicked me out of the place, fellers!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI.
<br /><span class="small">ON THE WINGS OF THE NIGHT WIND.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;A bear!&rdquo; shrieked Bumpus, struggling to his
knees; &ldquo;and he shoved me around like I was a bundle
of hay! Did you ever hear of such nerve?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think what he did to me?&rdquo; cried Step Hen entering
through the partly open door; &ldquo;I was just
pokin&rsquo; my nose out, to get a whiff of fresh air, for
I couldn&rsquo;t hardly breathe in here; when he sent me
a flyin&rsquo;, just like you&rsquo;d kick for goal on the gridiron.
Guess I covered all of ten feet, and landed in them
bushes out there. Look here! See what I got off&rsquo;n
the old beast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He opened his clenched hand, and exhibited a
bunch of long black hairs. Undoubtedly Step Hen
must have involuntarily clutched at the bear as they
came in contact, and had managed to hold on to
these tokens of the collision.</p>
<p>Thad was laughing and shaking all over, so were
Eli and Jim; and Allan joined in. Presently the
whole of them began to see the ludicrous side of the
adventure, and even Sebattis was noticed to be
grinning. Nobody had ever known him to emit a
genuine laugh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And just to think how near we came to having
bear steak for breakfast, instead of that old tough
moose meat,&rdquo; remarked Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Step Hen took occasion
to say; &ldquo;but if a feller c&rsquo;n judge from the way he
kicked <i>me</i>, that bear was some tough too. My!
I&rsquo;d sure hate to put on the gloves with him in a bout.
I just had time to turn and look around, when I
heard that big bump; then he jumped me, and out
we both went. Mebbe I ain&rsquo;t glad now I didn&rsquo;t keep
right on going up that ladder when I started. Just
think what a time I&rsquo;d had up there with him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow, and again I say, wow!&rdquo; snapped Giraffe.
&ldquo;Things seem to be happening right thick and fast
now, fellers. This sure is the big game country, all
right, and to the good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were all of one opinion with respect to that.
To get one night a lordly moose bull, and by the romantic
way of calling, too; and then the very next
to run across a big burly bear, was as fine a piece of
good luck as any of them could wish for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder what&rsquo;s coming along next in line?&rdquo; remarked
Bumpus, nervously, as he made sure to get
close to the fire, and away from the open door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, you don&rsquo;t think that old bear&rsquo;d have the
nerve to come back here on second thoughts, and try
to clean out the whole bunch?&rdquo; Step Hen queried;
&ldquo;because I&rsquo;ve seen all I want of him. They say
three times and out; but I reckon it was only once
with me; and I went, too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of him,&rdquo; Bumpus declared;
&ldquo;but then there might be a few elephants or
rhinoceroses, or camels, or something else hanging
around these diggings, waiting to get acquainted.
I don&rsquo;t like meetin&rsquo; up with &rsquo;em so sudden like.
Whiff! bang! and then good-bye! Why, it ain&rsquo;t
decent to treat a feller that way without bein&rsquo; introduced
first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to think that the sly old critter was up
there all the time we kept talkin&rsquo; and carryin&rsquo; on
down here?&rdquo; said Davy Jones, who had come out
of the affair with only a skinned knee, owing to
striking up against some wood on the floor, when he
threw himself wildly to one side at sight of the descending
bear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye think ever started him movin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
asked Bumpus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smoke do it,&rdquo; replied Eli. &ldquo;The ole bear, he
lies quiet, not knowin&rsquo; what to make o&rsquo; us comin&rsquo;
in here, whar he&rsquo;s expectin&rsquo; to take up his winter
quarters. But purty soon thet smoke it begins to
smart his eyes. Bears don&rsquo;t like smoke, any more&rsquo;n
any animile does. So gettin&rsquo; frightened arter a
while, he starts down the ladder, misses his grip, an&rsquo;
lands in a heap on the floor. If I&rsquo;d be&rsquo;n able tuh git
hold o&rsquo; a gun I&rsquo;d a guv him his pill; but I guess it&rsquo;d
be&rsquo;n dangerous work shootin&rsquo; in here, with so many
&rsquo;raound.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Will we ever run across him again?&rdquo; remarked
Step Hen, as he felt all over his body, to ascertain
how many scratches or bruises had resulted from
the rather hurried way in which he took his recent
departure. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind being fired from a cannon,&rdquo;
he continued, as several twinges of pain told
him he had not come through the ordeal entirely unscathed;
&ldquo;but I draw the line at being made a football
by a scared bear. Wonder he didn&rsquo;t break
every rib I have. As &rsquo;tis, I wouldn&rsquo;t be much
s&rsquo;prised if a dozen or so were fractured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll make you a strait jacket to-morrow,
and keep you in a plaster cast the rest of the
trip,&rdquo; declared Giraffe; chuckling in rare good
humor, because, for once at least, he had not been
caught up in the little whirl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like fun you will,&rdquo; grumbled Step Hen, getting
Bumpus to rub his back for him, on promise of returning
the favor in kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I think somebody ought to go up and look
that loft over,&rdquo; suggested Davy Jones. &ldquo;How do
we know but what it&rsquo;s just full of bears right now.
&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t the nicest thing to think such a load&rsquo;s goin&rsquo;
to drop down on your head any old time. He might
upset my coffee when I get to drinkin&rsquo;, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, to quiet the boys, Jim climbed up, taking the
little electric torch along with him. Upon his reporting
that all was clear some of the others also
ascended, to see where the bear had been sleeping at
the time of their arrival.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, if there was only a couple of nice jolly
little cubs around, we&rsquo;d have heaps of fun playing
with &rsquo;em,&rdquo; Bumpus suggested, as he too examined
the loft, and saw where the bear had been making
a soft sleeping place out of dead leaves that must
have drifted in through a hole at the end of the
roof, but much too small to let the big beast go out
that way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cubs! listen to him, would you?&rdquo; cried Step
Hen. &ldquo;Why, it ain&rsquo;t the time of year for cubs;
and if it was, I&rsquo;d like to see <i>you</i> playin&rsquo; with any,
while the old missus was alive, and hangin&rsquo; around.
She&rsquo;d cub you with a club, worse&rsquo;n she did me; and
don&rsquo;t you forget it, Bumpus. Cubs! Well, what
queer things you do see when you haven&rsquo;t a gun,&rdquo;
and the way he looked at the fat boy when saying
this made Bumpus bristle up immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you call me a <i>thing</i>, Step Hen!&rdquo; he admonished,
severely; at which there was a shout
from the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He admits it all, fellers;&rdquo; Davy Jones exclaimed;
&ldquo;he puts on the shoe first thing. But then,
Bumpus, we know you ain&rsquo;t up on natural history.
It&rsquo;s a wonder you didn&rsquo;t say that was a hippopotamus,
or a crocodile, instead of a bear. You&rsquo;re
bound to know more about these things before you
get back to Cranford again. We&rsquo;ll let it go at that.
How&rsquo;s that supper gettin&rsquo; on, Giraffe? Anything
more I c&rsquo;n do to help?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Anything more?&rdquo; echoed the cook, disdainfully;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know the first thing you&rsquo;ve done
to help get it. Didn&rsquo;t he say he felt one of them fits
acomin&rsquo; on when we landed here, fellers; and then
on top of that, you got so scared by that old bear
dropping down on us, you couldn&rsquo;t hardly move. I
just see you helpin&rsquo;, when you c&rsquo;n crawl out of it.
The only help you&rsquo;ll give will be when supper&rsquo;s
ready for servin&rsquo;, and then it&rsquo;ll be to make way with
the stuff good and hearty. I notice you never get
one of them cramps right then, Davy; oh, no!
They&rsquo;re right handy things to have in the house,
ain&rsquo;t they. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to borrow a few sometime,
see if I don&rsquo;t now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In good time the supper was pronounced ready,
Eli having assisted in its preparation; for, with nine
hungry voyagers to feed, the amount that had to be
prepared made the task no light one.</p>
<p>As usual, they made merry while disposing of the
food that had been gotten ready. Some of the
moose was cut up as small as possible, and made into
a palatable stew. Then they had Boston baked
beans; and some pretty fair biscuits, which Eli
baked in the little portable oven that was carried in
one of the boats. Of course coffee made a part of
the supper. At home possibly few of these lads ever
drank coffee more than once a day, and at breakfast
at that; but here in the woods the meal would seem
rather tame without the warm cup that every one
looked for.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say to stopping here a day or so,
boys?&rdquo; asked Thad. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been talking it over with
Eli, and he says we couldn&rsquo;t find a better place for
game. Perhaps, now, one of the rest of you may
run across a moose bigger even than mine; or Bumpus
here stands a chance of meeting up with his
friend, the bear, who gave him that handshake in
passing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; Bumpus hastened to say; &ldquo;that
doesn&rsquo;t mean I object to hanging out at the Hotel
Log Cabin as long as the rest of you see fit; but I
don&rsquo;t hanker after meetin&rsquo; up with that rude black
pirate again. He may be a pretty fine kind of a
bear, as bears go; but I object to the breed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Count us all as saying we&rsquo;ll be glad of a break
in the journey, Thad,&rdquo; Allan remarked, just then.
&ldquo;Besides, we must be somewhere near where that
Mr. Carson is hunting, right now; and at any time
we might run up against him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Step Hen, Giraffe and Davy nodded their heads,
as though to intimate that Allan voiced the sentiments
of all when he said that.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing I&rsquo;ve got in my mind, and it&rsquo;s
this,&rdquo; Bumpus went on to remark. &ldquo;Now&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to
be the time for Allan here to keep his promise to
show me a bee tree. He told me that summer was
the time to do it, when the bees were on the wing,
and he could work his little game; but that he&rsquo;d try
his best to &rsquo;commodate me any time, once we got
up here in Maine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so I will,&rdquo; replied the other, smiling at the
earnestness with which Bumpus kept talking on
that one subject. &ldquo;Perhaps Jim, or Eli here, will
help me find a tree. If the bees are hived up for
winter, then the only way we can do it is to listen
when the noonday sun is shining. Sometimes, before
the weather gets too cold, the young bees come
out of their hole, and buzz around, trying their
wings. I&rsquo;ve found a hive in the dead top of a tree
that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And got a lovely stock of juicy honeycomb too,
I guess?&rdquo; said Giraffe, making a face to indicate
that the subject certainly appealed to him from the
standpoint of a sweet luxury, if from nothing else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure we did; and a lovely lot of stings thrown
in,&rdquo; chuckled Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they say bee stings are good for rheumatism,
and I&rsquo;ve sometimes thought I was getting a
touch of that in my legs,&rdquo; Davy Jones observed,
thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t much rheumatism about you when
that bear dropped down on us,&rdquo; said Giraffe, scornfully.
&ldquo;The way you scooted out of the way would
have made the best short distance sprinter turn
green with envy. Rheumatism! Wow! that goes
in line with cramps, I guess, now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll we put all the honey in?&rdquo; asked Bumpus,
just as though he counted the finding of the
bee tree an accomplished thing, because Allan had
agreed to do what he could to find one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hold all I can,&rdquo; retorted Giraffe, complacently;
&ldquo;but then you mustn&rsquo;t expect me to keep on
loading up, till I bust. I c&rsquo;n stretch sometimes; but
even that&rsquo;s no sign I&rsquo;m made of injy rubber, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we won&rsquo;t cook our rabbit till we&rsquo;ve got
him,&rdquo; said Allan. &ldquo;Sometimes most of the honey
in a bee tree is old, and candied. The new stuff is
what counts. The other is dark colored and sickening
sweet. But wait and see, if so be we&rsquo;re lucky
enough to strike one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After supper was over they enjoyed sitting there
before the fire, and listening to Eli tell stories about
the old cabin; which, according to his accounts,
must have seen many queer happenings at least
equal to the one surprise to which they had been
treated, on their first acquaintance with it on this
night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>Thad, being given a fair amount of imagination,
found it easy to shut his eyes, and believe he could
see the old trapper who once lived here, as Eli described
him. Years upon years he had come and
gone, as the winters passed, always taking toll of
the woods&rsquo; folks; yet never trying to make such a
deep inroad on their numbers but that there were
plenty left for breeding purposes. The wise old
trapper looked forward to another year. Finally
he had lost his life among the wild loggers of a
Maine river; being unfortunate enough to get
caught in a jam that he was trying to break.</p>
<p>When some of the boys, tired from the work of
the day, and lack of rest on the preceding night,
stretched out their blankets, and disputed about
where each should settle down later on. Thad and
Eli stepped out to see what the night promised for
the coming day. If it looked like snow they would
find good tracking weather; though for one Thad
hoped this would still keep off some little while, and
allow them to do some hunting before winter closed
on them.</p>
<p>The stars were shining brightly in the dark heavens.
The young moon had sunk to rest; but every
night now they might expect it to grow in size, until
in a week considerable light would come from this
source. And there is nothing more enjoyable when
in the depths of the wilderness, than a round, clear
moon.</p>
<p>As the two stood there, speaking of these things,
there came stealing on the night air a strange sound
that, although rising from a considerable distance
away from the cabin, still struck Thad as very
weird, and also blood-curdling. He had heard
watch dogs bay to the moon; but this was something
far more thrilling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no wildcat; and I don&rsquo;t think it can be a
panther, a bear or any animal I&rsquo;ve ever struck in the
woods. What do you make out of it, Eli?&rdquo; he
asked, turning to the old guide, whom he had heard
emit a whistle, as of astonishment, at the time that
queer howl was heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s be&rsquo;n many a year now, Thad, since ever I
heerd the like o&rsquo; thet howl,&rdquo; the Maine guide observed.
&ldquo;Time was when they uster be here in
plenty; but the bounty paid by the state, it just &rsquo;bout
cleaned the hull lot out; er else they thort as how
&rsquo;twar safer up yonder, acrost the line in Canada.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; exclaimed Thad; &ldquo;do you mean
to tell me that was a wolf?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A real wolf, an&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; else,&rdquo; answered Eli;
&ldquo;an&rsquo; let me tell ye, it do bring back the old days,
fur me to listen to thet howl. This is like livin&rsquo;
again.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII.
<br /><span class="small">A FACE IN THE WINDOW.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh! that right, Eli; wolf only cry like that!&rdquo;
said a voice close beside the two who stood there;
and turning, they could make out a figure which
they knew must be that of Sebattis; but so softly
had the Indian slipped out, after hearing that well-known
though faint howl, that even Eli, sharp ears
though he possessed, had not detected his coming
until he spoke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where thar&rsquo;s one wolf thar&rsquo;s agoin&rsquo; ter be
more,&rdquo; remarked the old Maine guide, with the air
of one who knew what he was talking about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! wolf he always hunt in pack, never by
self,&rdquo; observed Sebattis, drily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That adds a little spicy flavor to our being up
here, then,&rdquo; Thad went on to say, being not displeased;
for if only he could have that magical little
rifle of Step Hen&rsquo;s in his hands, he cared not how
many of the fierce brutes he might run across; for
with its quick-shooting qualities, and the deadly nature
of the bullets it used, he believed he could take
care of all comers. Besides, if hard-pressed, it was
always possible to take to a tree, where one would
be safe from the cruel fangs of the animals.</p>
<p>When they went inside, and told what they had
heard, the boys received the news with various
shades of enthusiasm. Giraffe was really pleased,
for he meant to do something bold on this trip that
would forever establish his reputation as a mighty
Nimrod; Step Hen fondled his rifle, and then stood
it in the corner close to the spot where he had
spread his blanket, as though he had a faint idea he
might find need for it in the night; Davy Jones
shrugged his shoulders, and hoped he would not
happen to run across the pack when alone; and as
for Bumpus, he deliberately changed his blanket,
placing it on the further side of several others,
away from that open door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>But Eli had been examining that same door, and
was of the opinion that, with a little effort, it might
be coaxed to shut. This he proceeded to accomplish,
and with a success that won him a cheer from
the timid Bumpus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never did like to sleep in a draught,&rdquo; muttered
the fat scout; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m glad the glass stayed in that
window all these years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is queer, for a fact,&rdquo; observed Thad.
&ldquo;But I reckon now it would never have held out if
some of the fellows we have in Cranford had come
along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hit it right about that, Thad,&rdquo; agreed Step
Hen. &ldquo;Take that Ambrose Griffin and his cronies,
Eli Bangs and Walt Hopkins, and they never could
pass an empty house without shyin&rsquo; stones at the
windows. I&rsquo;ve heard a smash many a time, and
seen one of them scootin&rsquo; away like hot cakes.
Guess they like to hear the jingle of the broken
glass; it must sound like music to some fellers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s thet ye say &rsquo;bout Eli?&rdquo; asked the old
guide, pricking up his ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! we weren&rsquo;t talking about you that time,&rdquo;
laughed Thad. &ldquo;It happens that you&rsquo;ve got a
namesake down in the town where we live, who&rsquo;s up
to every trick there is, that he thinks will afford him
some fun;&rdquo; and as the guide expressed an interest
in the matter, Thad detailed a few of the practical
jokes which were believed to lie at the doors of the
three bad boys of Cranford.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>When he heard about the lights going out at the
church, just when a convert was about to be immersed,
and the cries of the alarmed audience, together
with shrieks from the frightened woman,
who really thought she had been transplanted from
this world into another, since everything became
suddenly black around her, the guide grinned. He
had never heard of such carrying on, and thought
it was comical. But Thad knew that more than one
person had need of a doctor after that episode; and
that if actual proof could be procured concerning
the culprits who cut the electric wires, they would
have been severely punished by the town fathers.</p>
<p>Somehow none of the boys seemed in such a
hurry to lie down now. Thad&rsquo;s stories of events
which they knew from first hands started them talking
again; and by degrees some of the rest related
other doings that were commonly laid at the door of
the three Cranford scapegraces.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>Bumpus changed his blanket three separate times
in the course of half an hour. There was no
draught now to complain of, since Eli had managed
to get the door closed; but Thad noticed the
fat and timid scout eying that wide throat of the
chimney; and really believed Bumpus had come to
suspect that it was large enough to admit of the passage
of one of those hungry wolves, should they
find all other avenues of ingress closed to them.
And he did not fancy being directly in the road of
the first one that came in.</p>
<p>Bumpus knew that he must prove a juicy morsel
for any half-starved beast of prey; and that, given
the chance, they were just sure to pick him out.
Giraffe was playing safe under any considerations,
for the animal that would prefer that bag of bones
must be out of its mind.</p>
<p>And Thad also made up his mind that after Bumpus
got fairly to sleep he would manage to get possession
of the gun he had hitched closer to him, and
which was the double-barreled weapon carried into
the woods by Davy, who had made no protest when
the stout boy coolly appropriated the same.</p>
<p>There could be no telling but that Bumpus, with
his mind worked up over that bear, and the wolf
that had howled away off up the river, might dream
he was being hotly attacked. And a gun in the possession
of a greenhorn can be even more dangerous
under such conditions than if an adept handled it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just thought of a good thing,&rdquo; suddenly
exclaimed Bumpus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then get it out of your system in a hurry, or
it&rsquo;ll hurt you,&rdquo; said Giraffe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No danger of anything good ever hurting <i>you</i>,
Giraffe,&rdquo; declared the other, with a fine show of sarcasm
that caused the tall scout to grin; for somehow,
when he and Bumpus got to exchanging compliments,
Giraffe always seemed rather tickled if
the other managed to give him a sly dig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s hear what struck you, all of a sudden,&rdquo;
he remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about our honey,&rdquo; began Bumpus, seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What honey?&rdquo; demanded Giraffe, pretending
to look all around. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen any, that I
know of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! you know what I mean;&rdquo; Bumpus went
on; &ldquo;the honey we expect to get, when Allan finds
the bee tree. I&rsquo;m just as dead sure he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to do
it, as I am of having my breakfast to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I reckon Allan only wishes he was as sure
as you are,&rdquo; Giraffe remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him tell what&rsquo;s on his mind, can&rsquo;t you,
Giraffe?&rdquo; broke in Davy Jones. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a
shame how you badger that poor fellow. Don&rsquo;t you
know there&rsquo;s a law against cruelty to animals?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monkeys are included under that law, please
remember,&rdquo; retorted the fat boy, as he turned on his
new tormentor. &ldquo;But I suppose you fellows are
just dying to know the brilliant thought that just
flashed into my mind a little while ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, and get it out,&rdquo; begged Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we want to know, if we&rsquo;re not from
Missouri,&rdquo; added Allan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there isn&rsquo;t any reason why we should
waste a whole lot of it after all, if we only know
enough to use our brains, and take advantage of
our opportunities,&rdquo; Bumpus went on, with exasperating
slowness, as though this might be his
method of getting even for the attack upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of opportunities?&rdquo; demanded Davy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Storage capacity,&rdquo; answered the other, simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, its all very well to want to save the
honey,&rdquo; observed Giraffe, eying the other suspiciously;
&ldquo;but if you expect us to fill up our kettles,
and every dish we&rsquo;ve got along with us, you&rsquo;re off
your base, Bumpus. We have to eat three times a
day; and just fancy having even the coffee pot
jammed full of sticky sweetness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess again,&rdquo; remarked Bumpus, composedly.
&ldquo;Well, I suppose that I&rsquo;ll just <i>have</i> to tell you, because
you&rsquo;d never get on to such a brilliant idea in
a thousand years. First thing, you didn&rsquo;t know I
brought it along, perhaps. Don&rsquo;t hardly understand
myself just why I borrowed it from Smithy; but I
must have thought it&rsquo;d come in handy, sometime or
other. And it&rsquo;s going to, fellows; it&rsquo;s going to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is?&rdquo; shouted Giraffe, now at the end of
his patience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that cute little collapsible rubber foot
bath belonging to our comrade, Smithy. You know
he was such a clean feller, that he just couldn&rsquo;t think
of going anywhere at first, without carrying that
tub along. It holds quite a lot; and if we filled it
with nice sweet honey&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>But poor Bumpus did not get any further in his
explanation. Roars of laughter broke in upon his
story; for the idea of filling a rubber foot bath with
the sticky product of a bee tree was too much for
the rest of the boys. And Bumpus, after staring
around in a hurt way, shrugged his fat shoulders,
and relapsed into silence, simply remarking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! all right; that&rsquo;s all a feller gets for crackin&rsquo;
his brain trying to think up things for the benefit of
the whole bunch. I just guess that old bear&rsquo;ll get
the main part of our honey, after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that? Do bears like honey, Allan?&rdquo; demanded
Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say they did,&rdquo; replied the Maine lad,
readily enough. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re just wild over it. A
bear will overturn a hive, if ever he gets in a garden,
and devour comb and all, like a regular pig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the bees,&rdquo; continued the tall scout; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
they sting him at all? Think of the thousands of
little critters, each with his poison lance, stinging
that poor bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem to bother the bear one bit,&rdquo;
Allan added. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known them to just clean out
a hive; and when we shot the varmint just afterward,
he didn&rsquo;t seem to have a swollen head from
any stings. But if we should be lucky enough to find
a bee tree, perhaps we&rsquo;ll coax our friend, the bear
that was in this cabin, to come around; and then
some of you can get a crack at him. His hide would
make a rug to be proud of, especially if you had
killed the beast yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Count me in on that game,&rdquo; said Giraffe, earnestly.
&ldquo;I boasted to the boys at home that I was
goin&rsquo; to bag a big bear; and if I don&rsquo;t make good
they&rsquo;ll give me the laugh, you see. And then we&rsquo;ll
find out whether this heavy old rifle that belonged to
my uncle, ain&rsquo;t equal to a new-fangled little popgun
that shoots spreader bullets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys had begun to show new signs of quieting
down. Some were yawning again, and the
chances were the signal to crawl under the blankets
would presently have been given by Thad.</p>
<p>It was Bumpus who suddenly aroused the whole
party. He sat upright on the floor, and pointed directly
at the window that was opposite to where he
had last thrown his blanket down. Thad saw that
the face of the fat boy really expressed surprise, not
to mention consternation, as he cried out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I wonder who that was I saw peek in at
the window just then, and draw back when he
caught me lookin&rsquo; at him. A white man, too, fellers,
it was, believe me; I ain&rsquo;t foolin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody jumped up, the three guides as well
as the boys, when Bumpus made this astonishing
declaration. But although their eyes instantly
sought the window indicated, the cob-webbed glass
betrayed no sign of the presence of any one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><span class="small">THE MARKED SHOE AGAIN.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got &rsquo;em again, boys!&rdquo; exclaimed Giraffe, in
utter disgust. &ldquo;You know, time was when our
friend Bumpus was always seein&rsquo; things? He used
to get us up in the middle of the night huntin&rsquo;
around for all sorts of crazy wild beasts; and then,
after we&rsquo;d been nearly frozen, he&rsquo;d yawn, say he
guessed he must a been dreamin&rsquo; again, and turn
over to go to sleep. Now he&rsquo;s beginnin&rsquo; to see
things with his eyes open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody looked severely at Bumpus. Thad
knew the ways of the fat boy as well as any one
could. And he understood that the other could not
keep a straight face when attempting anything like
a practical joke. A whimsical little grin would always
betray Bumpus to shrewd and searching eyes.</p>
<p>But just then he had a solemn look. Bumpus
even seemed to be aggrieved that his word should
be so lightly taken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I ain&rsquo;t foolin&rsquo;, I tell you,&rdquo; he persisted. &ldquo;I
really and truly did see somethin&rsquo; that <i>looked</i> like
a man&rsquo;s face, peek in at that window!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! hear him beginning to hedge, would you?&rdquo;
cried Davy, fiercely. &ldquo;First it was a man, and a
white man too. Now he says it just looked like a
man. Pretty soon he&rsquo;ll up and admit that he
<i>thought</i> he saw something moving out there; and
when we rush out to hunt around, I guess we&rsquo;ll find
only the limb of a tree that waves in the night wind.
Oh! you Bumpus, we know you, all right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! very well, if you don&rsquo;t believe me when I
say so, and hold up my hand this way, why, I
haven&rsquo;t got another thing to say,&rdquo; grumbled the fat
boy. &ldquo;But if I didn&rsquo;t see a face there, why, I&rsquo;ll, yes,
I&rsquo;ll eat my hat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; remarked Thad, whom the guides
had been watching, to take their cue from his actions,
&ldquo;it ought to be easy to prove Bumpus&rsquo; statement
one way or the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that, Thad?&rdquo; asked Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, all we have to do is to ask Sebattis here,
or Eli, or Jim, to step outside and look for tracks!&rdquo;
remarked the patrol leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well what do you think of that for a bright lot
of scouts?&rdquo; laughed Giraffe. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we
ought to have thought of the first thing. And the
sooner they get busy, the quicker we&rsquo;ll know whether
Bumpus saw anything, or just thought he did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad turned on the guides, and smiling, nodded
his head. With that signal, which they easily understood,
both Eli and the Indian darted over to the
fire; while the boys watched them curiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s torches they&rsquo;re after!&rdquo; exclaimed
Bumpus, seeing the guides picking out blazing
brands that, to their practiced eyes, offered all the
advantages which a lantern might supply.</p>
<p>Doubtless one of the three men would have hastened
to the door and pushed out to investigate,
as soon as Bumpus raised his racket; only, hearing
Giraffe making fun of the fat boy, they suspected it
was only a prank he might be playing; and none of
them wished to be caught as the victim of a practical
joke.</p>
<p>The door was somewhat difficult to open, but
stout Jim threw his weight upon it, and had a passage
for his fellow guides when they were ready to
step out.</p>
<p>Of course every one of the scouts hustled after,
even Bumpus, which fact seemed to speak well for
his sincerity. Thad himself secretly believed that
there might be something in what Bumpus had said;
and he prepared himself to hear such an announcement
from one of the two who were intending to
look for signs.</p>
<p>The very first thing both Sebattis and Eli did,
after emerging from the hut, was to swing their
torches violently around their heads. These made
a hissing sound and the strange action quite aroused
the curiosity of some of the scouts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever are they doing that for?&rdquo; asked Step
Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like they might be signallin&rsquo; to somebody,
and sayin&rsquo; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s all off,&rsquo;&rdquo; Davy remarked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>But somehow Giraffe, knowing all about fires,
and what uses they could be put to, laughed at their
dense ignorance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; he declared with an air of
superior wisdom, &ldquo;when they whirl &rsquo;em around
swiftly that way, it starts the flame to burning more
fiercely, and so they get better light. See, what did
I tell you? Ain&rsquo;t they burnin&rsquo; to beat the band now?
Talk about your electric torch, bah! it ain&rsquo;t in the
same class with a good live firebrand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both the Penobscot Indian and the old Maine
guide had pushed close up under the window by this
time. It was seen that they carefully watched
where they were stepping, as though not wanting
to interfere with any tracks that might happen to
lie there.</p>
<p>Bumpus in particular watched their every move
as though fascinated. His veracity had been attacked
by his fellow scouts, and he was waiting to
see them &ldquo;eat humble pie&rdquo; pretty soon; for a face
could not appear at the little dusty window without
having connection with a human body; and that in
turn could not get there save through the aid of a
pair of legs; which would be connected with feet
that must leave some sort of trail.</p>
<p>No doubt that was the way Bumpus was figuring
it out, as he stood back with the others, and
watched.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>Eli evidently realized that though he might be
an experienced hand at all such things as finding
tracks and following them, under difficulties that
might daunt many men, he could hardly expect to
place himself in the same class with a genuine son of
the forest.</p>
<p>Therefore, Thad noticed that the old Maine guide
seemed to purposely allow Sebattis to have the leading
chance. He might know more than the Indian
on many subjects, but was ready to &ldquo;play second
fiddle&rdquo; as Giraffe expressed it, when there was a
trail to discover, or read.</p>
<p>Hardly had the red guide reached the side of the
cabin near the window, than he made a slight motion
with his hand. Eli had evidently been waiting
for some such signal as this. He quickly moved
over to where the other bent down; and the two of
them seemed to be looking closely at something.</p>
<p>A minute later they moved forward, a step at a
time, and evidently following some tracks that were
plainly marked upon the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; chuckled Bumpus; only that and nothing
more; but the one word contained a world of
meaning, and must have given him great satisfaction.</p>
<p>Perhaps, had he happened to be next to Giraffe,
instead of Thad, he might have given the long-legged
scout a sly dig in the ribs, and in this way let
him understand that he believed his vindication in
a fair way of being made complete.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got something, that&rsquo;s sure,&rdquo; declared
Davy Jones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now they&rsquo;re right under the window, too.&rdquo;
added Step Hen. &ldquo;Guess Bumpus wasn&rsquo;t dreamin&rsquo;
after all. He saw a face, all right. Look at &rsquo;em
movin&rsquo; off now. Say, Thad, you don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re
goin&rsquo; to try and follow the owner of that face up till
they get him, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, hardly,&rdquo; returned the patrol leader. &ldquo;I
suppose they just want to make sure he did skip out,
after he saw Bumpus had discovered him. And
that looks like the fellow hardly cared to join our
family circle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who under the sun could he be, Thad?&rdquo;
asked Step Hen. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s more or less game
around these diggings p&rsquo;raps some trapper&rsquo;s made
up his mind to stay up here all winter, and take pelts.
When he saw our crowd, he was that disgusted he
just pulled up stakes, and lit out for all he was
worth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re away off there, Step Hen,&rdquo; declared
Giraffe. &ldquo;Now, if I was asked my opinion,
which nobody seems to care shucks for, I&rsquo;d say
that feller might be one of the two guides Mr.
James W. Carson took into the woods with him.
You see, I reckon there&rsquo;s a heap of jealousy between
all these same guides; and it galled him to know that
after they&rsquo;d gone and fetched the gentleman away
up here, promisin&rsquo; that he&rsquo;d have all the big game
huntin&rsquo; he wanted, without being bothered by any
other party, they had to run smack up against a
pack of Boy Scouts, out on a trip. That&rsquo;s why he
scooted the way he did, I say.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>Giraffe looked toward Thad, as though wishing
he would speak up, and either substantiate his opinion,
or else advance a new one. But the patrol
leader was closely watching the guides, and made
no remark.</p>
<p>Sebattis and Eli had not gone far away. They
seemed to be satisfied with following the trail just
a little distance; and then turning, came back. Arriving
under the window again they beckoned the
others to approach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t walk over this patch right hyar, boys,&rdquo;
warned the old guide, pointing down close to his
feet; and from this they understood that the marks
lay there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s thar, all right, Thad,&rdquo; remarked Eli, with a
grin. &ldquo;Seems like the boy, he was right arter all,
an&rsquo; sum critter was a peekin&rsquo; in at us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both Thad and Allan of course looked down at
the ground. The guides held their blazing pine-knots
closer, so that they could see better.</p>
<p>The impression of human foot could not be easily
mistaken for the track of any sort of wild beast.
Even the most ignorant tenderfoot scout that ever
joined a troop must have known that fact at a
glance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>But the patrol leader and the Maine boy seemed
to discover something about the imprint of a shoe
that caused them to stare. The balance of the
scouts realized that something was about to happen
beyond the ordinary: for they pushed in closer,
and waited for either of the two experts to advance
an opinion.</p>
<p>Allan looked at Thad, and the other returned his
glance with a nod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seen that track before, eh, Allan?&rdquo; Thad remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sure have, for a fact,&rdquo; replied the Maine lad,
positively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember how you found a footprint at that
other camp of ours, before the sheriff came along;
it had a patch across the sole, and so has this one.
So it stands to reason that the same fellow made
both prints. And didn&rsquo;t Sheriff Green tell us the
leader of those hobo burglars wore a shoe that had
just this same criss-cross patch on the sole? That
looks like we might be somewhere close to that
bunch of rascals right now; and that the sheriff
must have gone off on the wrong scent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other scouts listened to all this with wide-open
eyes, and expressions of both amazement and
eagerness; but it was Giraffe who voiced their feelings
when he exclaimed, drawing in a long breath:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow! and again I say, wow!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><span class="small">FIGURING IT OUT.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Told you so!&rdquo; Bumpus could not refrain from
saying, in triumph.</p>
<p>Thad turned on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you let us know what the fellow looked
like, Bumpus?&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;If we happen on
him in any of our wanderings, it might be just as
well that we knew the kind of customer we have to
deal with. Can you describe him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not, Thad,&rdquo; replied the fat boy, a
little dejectedly. &ldquo;You see, just as quick as he
caught sight of me turning my eyes up there, he
ducked. And all I saw was that he had a face, and
a kinder hairy one at that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! you mean he wore a beard?&rdquo; asked the
other.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure he did,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what
made me wonder whether it might have been a
monkey of some sort, even if I didn&rsquo;t say as much
to Giraffe when he was kidding me. But I happened
to remember that <i>ordinary</i> monkeys don&rsquo;t
grow up here in Maine,&rdquo; and the suggestive look he
shot in the direction of Davy made that comrade
sneer; as though he had grown hardened to being
classed with the tree-climbing tribe, just because he
could hang by his toes from a limb, or go up to the
tiptop of any tree that he had ever seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he came, and he saw; but he didn&rsquo;t conquer,
not by a long sight,&rdquo; observed Step Hen.
&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t like our looks one little bit, fellows, and
made tracks out of here. What d&rsquo;ye s&rsquo;pose brought
him around, in the first place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mout a be&rsquo;n jest passin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; seein&rsquo; our light in
hyar, thort he&rsquo;d cum ter look us up. If he&rsquo;s thet
kind o&rsquo; a varmint, he mebbe thort as how thar was
good pickin&rsquo;s ter be bed. But he knows better now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Eli who advanced this opinion. Thad had
another one that was based on certain facts obtained
from the Maine sheriff who had dropped in on their
camp so unexpectedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that was the man called Charley Barnes,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;you must remember that we heard he used
to be a guide up in this country long ago, before
he took to his present calling. And in that case,
why, perhaps he may have known of this old cabin
here, and was coming to see if it would make a half-way
decent place to stay for a while. Perhaps one
of his friends is sick; or it might be they feel that
they just have to hold over somewhere, so as to lay
in a stock of food. That&rsquo;s an idea the sheriff had,
I recollect; and he wanted to keep so hot on their
track that they&rsquo;d find no time for hunting, and must
get hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it <i>was</i> a man, anyway, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; asked
Bumpus, demurely; for he felt that Giraffe owed
him an apology of some sort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was a man,&rdquo; admitted that worthy,
frankly; &ldquo;and for once you&rsquo;ve got a bulge on me,
Bumpus. Rub it in all you want to; my hide&rsquo;s about
as thick as the skin of a rhinoceros, and I c&rsquo;n stand
it easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s all right, Giraffe,&rdquo; replied the other,
ready to forgive, now that things were coming his
way; &ldquo;I was only thinkin&rsquo; how queer it seems to
have them hobo burglars huntin&rsquo; us up. Remember
what I said about that fat reward we&rsquo;d get, if we
happened to pull &rsquo;em in? A big thousand dollars,
Mr. Green said it was; and p&rsquo;raps double that by
now. Well, funnier things have happened, understand,
than a pack of Brave Scouts, tried and
true, rounding up a bunch of cowardly hoboes.
We can do it, fellers, and not half try, if we get the
chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Thad thought it one of the queerest things
he had ever seen, to watch how the fire of enthusiasm
seemed to burn within the breast of the usually
rather timid and backward Bumpus Hawtree. Evidently
he had his mind set on that reward; and
could see how splendidly it would come in for the
patrol, in paying the expenses of another long vacation
trip they had in mind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if he&rsquo;ll come back any more?&rdquo; remarked
Step Hen, as they began to move into the
cabin again, there being no further reason for remaining
out in the cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon now, he saw all he wanted, and didn&rsquo;t
care about waiting to be introduced to such a gang,&rdquo;
Giraffe chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak for yourself, Giraffe,&rdquo; remarked Davy,
disdainfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just can&rsquo;t get over Bumpus, here, showing
such a strong desire to grab these burglar fellers,&rdquo;
Giraffe went on. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; over him, do you
think? We never used to think him daring or bold.
He always said his heft kept him from joining in
with the rest of the boys, when they skated over a
&lsquo;ticklish bender&rsquo; in the ice; and that it&rsquo;d sure
break with him. Same way about doin&rsquo; a lot of
stunts. Now here he is, tryin&rsquo; to copy after Davy
Jones in some of his monkey-shines; and makin&rsquo;
the rest of us look like thirty cents when it comes to
wantin&rsquo; to surround these here ferocious hoboes, and
take &rsquo;em prisoners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpus shrugged his fat shoulders, and tried to
look indifferent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! that&rsquo;s because you never really knew what
I had in me,&rdquo; he said, calmly, though Thad could
see the merry twinkle in his eyes; &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t always
the savage lookin&rsquo; feller that turns out a <i>real</i> hero,
when the time comes around. Often the quiet,
modest, retirin&rsquo; sort of chap jumps in, and saves the
drownin&rsquo; child.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh; and that&rsquo;s you, is it?&rdquo; demanded Giraffe,
as he settled himself down in his blanket, ready to
try for a little sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything seems to be comin&rsquo; my way,&rdquo; replied
Bumpus, proudly. &ldquo;All you have to do is to
wait for the turn of the tide. I&rsquo;m feelin&rsquo; just joyful.
let me tell you;&mdash;all but one thing;&rdquo; he added,
hastily. &ldquo;If I only knew about that letter business.
Did I deliver it at the bank; or was I silly enough to
forget, and lose it? Sometimes I c&rsquo;n just see myself
walkin&rsquo; in through the door of that bank, and deliverin&rsquo;
the old thing; then it all gets mixed up,
and for the life of me I just can&rsquo;t say one way or
t&rsquo;other. If one of you only remembered seeing me
go in, or come out; or if I said anything about
handin&rsquo; it over, it&rsquo;d ease my mind a heap, now, I tell
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every time Bumpus got to thinking about that
one trouble he lapsed into silence, because he did
not seem to get any sympathy from most of his
chums; Giraffe and Davy in particular being very
apt to taunt him on his poor memory. Step Hen
was not inclined to say very much, lest he draw the
vials of the fat boy&rsquo;s wrath down on his own head;
for as we know, Step Hen had a failing himself in
the line of forgetting what he had done with things
he owned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>Once more the boys crawled under their blankets.
Each of them had managed to manufacture some
sort of a pillow. One had taken his clothes bag,
and this example several of the rest copied, as
suiting their wants exactly. Bumpus, lacking
enough material, had gone out to the canoe and
brought in his old haversack, from which he extracted
the very rubber foot bath which he had
mentioned to his chums as belonging to Smithy.
This he crammed half full of other things, and declared
it made as soft a pillow as anybody wanted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better cover that rubber with a towel, or something
like it,&rdquo; remarked Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this feels so nice and cool,&rdquo; complained
Bumpus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may now, all right, but after a while, when
you sleep, it&rsquo;ll begin to draw like everything; and
the chances are, you&rsquo;ll look like a boiled lobster on
one side of your face by morning. I&rsquo;ve been there
myself, and know how it smarts and burns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Thad, for the advice, and I&rsquo;ll take
advantage of it right away,&rdquo; declared the stout
scout, sweetly. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it the best thing ever to have
a chum or two along, like Thad and Allan, who
know so many things? Why, if it wasn&rsquo;t for them,
the rest of us would look like the babes in the
woods.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let up on that chatter, please, Bumpus,&rdquo; grumbled
Step Hen. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; awful late, and we
ought to been asleep long ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, button up, Bumpus, I&rsquo;d rather hear you
snore than talk just now,&rdquo; came from under the
blanket that Giraffe had wrapped himself in, much
after the style of a mummy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. I&rsquo;ll just lie on my back, then, and try
to accommodate you,&rdquo; the other shot back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got one of my shoes handy, remember, and
if you so much as give one little snort I mean to shy
it over in that corner,&rdquo; Giraffe threatened.</p>
<p>The guides had been talking quietly among themselves,
and when Thad saw Sebattis open the door
and slip out, he could give a pretty good guess what
the Indian meant to do. Perhaps he suspected that
the hoboes, lacking a boat with which to make their
flight easier as long as the river continued navigable,
might return in numbers later in the night, in
order to help themselves from the stock of Oldtown
canvas canoes owned by the scouts&rsquo; party.</p>
<p>Yes, the shrewd Penobscot Indian did not mean
that such a disaster should come to pass; and doubtless
he and his fellow-guides had arranged for
sentry duty by turns during the entire night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>Thad felt perfectly secure with such wide-awake
videttes to look out for the approach of the enemy.
He would have gladly taken his turn on post if
asked; but it seemed as though the three guides considered
that a part of their duty. They had an easy
enough task as it was, with these boys so willing to
paddle in turn, make fires, help cook the meals, and
do all sorts of things that generally the guide has
fall on his shoulders alone.</p>
<p>Presently silence fell upon the cabin. The fire
smouldered on the great hearth, and occasionally
flamed up, only to die down again. If it got very
low, some one who happened to be awake at the
time, was supposed to quietly get up, and put more
fuel on; this had been anticipated, and there was
plenty under the shelter of the cabin roof.</p>
<p>Perhaps Bumpus believed that Giraffe really
meant that dire threat he made in connection with
his heavy shoe; at any rate he did not venture to lie
on his back at all, and therefore failed to emit anything
that could be called a snore.</p>
<p>Hours crept on, and the night wore away. Some
of the scouts never woke up once from the time they
dropped off to sleep until the delightful odor of boiling
coffee gave them to understand that dawn was at
hand, and Jim getting breakfast ready for the whole
outfit.</p>
<p>That caused the last of them to climb out, and
there was more or less chattering as they went outside
to try and find water that was not icy cold, in
order to wash their faces, and chase the last remnants
of sleep from their eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said Bumpus, looking up at the
brightening sky, and trying to keep from shivering
as he dashed water over his rosy face; &ldquo;if this is
goin&rsquo; to be a good day for bee tree huntin&rsquo;; because
I&rsquo;ll never be happy till I&rsquo;ve seen what a real honey
hole looks like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But remember,&rdquo; warned Giraffe, solemnly, &ldquo;we
ain&rsquo;t fillin&rsquo; our kettles an&rsquo; bath tubs with the honey.
I know where a heap of it c&rsquo;n be stowed away right
now; and that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; about. Hey! there&rsquo;s
Jim rattling the frying-pan with that big spoon. I
reckon breakfast&rsquo;s ready, before we are. Get a
move on, Bumpus!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV.
<br /><span class="small">THE LUCK THAT CAME TO BUMPUS.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Sebattis?&rdquo; asked Step Hen, as they
sat down to breakfast, there being a rude table in
the cabin, around which the boys could gather;
though the guides had to hold off, and either wait,
or else munch their food elsewhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fact; I thought there was somebody
missing!&rdquo; exclaimed Bumpus.</p>
<p>Somehow or other they all looked toward Thad,
as though he might be able to give an explanation.
And sure enough, he did.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, he beckoned to me about the time I came
out,&rdquo; the scoutmaster remarked, &ldquo;and told me he
was going to take a little turn along the trail of that
man. He hasn&rsquo;t come back yet; so I guess he&rsquo;s been
able to follow it some distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds real woodsy now,&rdquo; declared
Giraffe. &ldquo;Following the trail for me. I&rsquo;m struck
on everything that seems like Cooper&rsquo;s <i>Leatherstocking</i>.
Wonder whether he c&rsquo;n keep it right up till he
drops in on the crowd? P&rsquo;raps they ain&rsquo;t so very
far away from here, after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I just saw Sebattis pass the window; there
he is comin&rsquo; in right now,&rdquo; observed Step Hen.</p>
<p>The dusky-skinned guide was indeed entering
the door. And no one could tell by looking at his
inscrutable face whether Sebattis had met with success
or disappointment in his recent labors.</p>
<p>From the fact of his coming back so soon Thad
rather imagined that the latter must be the case.
He knew the Indian would volunteer no explanation
unless asked questions; and so Thad managed to
corner him while he was fixing his elkskin moccasins
over by the fire. When presently the patrol
leader came back to the rest of the scouts, he was
greeted by numerous demands that he communicate
what he had learned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sebattis followed the tracks for some distance,&rdquo;
Thad went on to say, as he poured himself another
cup of coffee; &ldquo;but after the fellow got a certain
distance from the cabin, he began to be more cautious.
It was just as if he thought some one might
want to follow him, and he did not mean they
should succeed. At any rate, he covered his tracks
so that even Sebattis was unable to find the trail
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s sure a fact that the hobo must be some
woodsman himself,&rdquo; Giraffe declared. &ldquo;I thought
an Indian could follow the trail of a fox, if he
wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Sebattis said he was willing to go back
again, and try further, and that he believed he <i>could</i>
find the trail again; but he wanted to make sure first
that we cared enough about it. From certain remarks
he had heard some of us make, he thought
we didn&rsquo;t care to make the acquaintance of the rascals.
We even said, you may remember, fellows,
that we hadn&rsquo;t lost any hoboes that we knew of, and
didn&rsquo;t mean to go out of our way to find any. And
so Sebattis came back to report.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you tell him, Thad?&rdquo; asked Step
Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; replied the other, &ldquo;that so long as they
didn&rsquo;t interfere with us, we had no reason to bother
our heads about these men. We had plenty of
things on hand, as it was, without trying burglar
catching. If they only let us alone, and didn&rsquo;t run
across our path, we&rsquo;d forget there were any such
chaps in the Maine woods.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just think of the lost chance to lay in a big wad
of the long green, enough to carry us all the way
across the continent, and see something of the Far
West, like we&rsquo;ve often talked about,&rdquo; whined
Bumpus.</p>
<p>Thad was indeed surprised to hear the fat boy
talk like this, for Bumpus was, as a rule, a very
peaceful boy, never willingly seeking trouble. Really,
this anxiety in connection with that valuable
letter, which he could not place, try as he would,
seemed to have upset him entirely, so that he was no
longer the same jolly Bumpus of old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which would you rather do to-day, Bumpus,&rdquo;
the scoutmaster asked; &ldquo;try and find these desperate
men, and like as not get the whole of us into
trouble; or hunt for a bee tree with Allan; while
Davy and myself go with Eli for a hunt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no hesitation now, for with a wide
grin Bumpus shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bee tree, first, last and all time for mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ditto here!&rdquo; Giraffe followed by saying, as he
laid a hand on the pit of his stomach, and bowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you make the try, Allan?&rdquo; queried the
stout scout, turning appealingly in the direction of
the second in command of the patrol.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do for goodness&rsquo; sake oblige the little fellow,&rdquo;
urged Giraffe. &ldquo;Because we&rsquo;ll sure hear of nothing
else every hour of the day. When that feller
gets a thing on his mind he makes me think of the
woman in the sleeping car, who kept saying out loud
in the night, again and again; &lsquo;Oh! I am <i>so</i> thirsty;
I am <i>so</i> thirsty!&rsquo; till a traveler, who couldn&rsquo;t sleep,
got up, and went and gave her a cup of water. He
was just tryin&rsquo; to drop off again when she started in,
and this time she kept sayin&rsquo;, &lsquo;Oh! I <i>was</i> so thirsty!
I <i>was</i> so thirsty!&rsquo; Then he gave up tryin&rsquo; to get a
snooze till she tired out. And that&rsquo;s the way with
Bumpus, boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But can we make the try this morning, Allan?&rdquo;
persisted the stout boy, when the laugh at his expense
had died away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better say yes, and save yourself a heap of
trouble,&rdquo; suggested Step Hen, who was himself a
little anxious to see how the search might be conducted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked Allan, &ldquo;nothing can be done
until about noon. If the sun seems fairly warm
then, we might have a chance to see bees flying, or
catch the drone of the swarm of young ones trying
their wings just outside the opening of the tree hive.
I&rsquo;ll set you all to work watching and listening; and
we&rsquo;ll see who the lucky one will be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me a lot of fellows make a living,
picking up things in these Maine woods, from honey
and bees wax, to lumbermen and pulp stuff choppers?&rdquo;
Thad remarked, with an inquiring glance
toward Allan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They do,&rdquo; replied the other, promptly. &ldquo;I
could tell you a heap about these people, some of
whom I&rsquo;ve even met in my trips around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then go on and tell us,&rdquo; urged Davy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we always like to know what&rsquo;s doing,&rdquo;
added Giraffe, as he helped himself to another flapjack,
which Jim, the younger guide, seemed to know
how to make in a way calculated to appeal to a
hungry camper&rsquo;s appetite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, first of all there&rsquo;s the spruce gum hunter,&rdquo;
Allan started to say. &ldquo;You can follow the snowshoe
trail of these busy chaps through pathless
stretches, and find their camp-fires glowing in many
a lonely glen. They get about between a dollar and
a dollar and a half a pound, for the stuff, and it&rsquo;s
worth all of that. They usually travel in pairs, and
collect many pounds in a season.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how do they manage to climb some of
these tall spruce trees we&rsquo;ve seen on our trip?&rdquo;
asked Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s easy enough,&rdquo; laughed the other.
&ldquo;Every spruce gum hunter has a pair of climbers
with him. You&rsquo;ve seen the telephone and telegraph
wire men use these, fastened to their legs with
straps. He has to have warm clothing; a curved
chisel, in the handle of which a pole is set; a fine
jack knife; and a gun. In the night he sits by the
fire, smoking, while he cleans his day&rsquo;s pick.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But he has to eat; tell us then how he totes his
grub along; and where does he put up at in the
woods? We haven&rsquo;t run across any hotels up here,
it strikes me?&rdquo; asked Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for his food,&rdquo; Allan continued, &ldquo;he drags
on a moose sled, and it&rsquo;s either a deserted camp, or
the lee side of a tree every night, as he happens to
find things. And he is satisfied with mighty little
in the way of food, trusting to his gun to eke things
out. With plenty of work, a few bushels of beans,
some flour and molasses, and perhaps some coffee,
a gum picker thinks himself well off for a winter&rsquo;s
campaign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have a good eye for gum trees?&rdquo; suggested
Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what he has,&rdquo; replied the accommodating
Allan. &ldquo;A near-sighted gum hunter, or even a
careless one, would miss many a chance to fill up
his pack. The keen picker runs his eye along every
trunk. Here and there he sees a tall spruce marked
by a seam, through which the sap has oozed, perhaps
for years. The bubbles have crept out, and been
clarified day by day by contact with sun and rain.
There they are, nuggets of amber and garnet, ready
for the picker&rsquo;s chisel. Sometimes he climbs up, and
taps away like a giant woodpecker. Then again,
when it pays to do it, the tree is felled; for of course
he has his axe along; no man would ever go into the
Maine woods without that, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I was in that business,&rdquo; spoke up Bumpus,
&ldquo;tell you what I&rsquo;d do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, then,&rdquo; said Giraffe, taking advantage of
the fat boy&rsquo;s abstraction to pick the pancake off his
plate, there being no more in the main dish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;d just have a few acres of extra fine
trees, and I&rsquo;d scar &rsquo;em good and hard, so they&rsquo;d
bleed. Then, in a year or two, I&rsquo;d just gather the
gum, like they do in the turpentine regions down
South.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea, Bumpus,&rdquo; declared Allan. &ldquo;But
another great man has thought of that same idea,
which isn&rsquo;t copyrighted either. Every year this
man, who is called the spruce gum king, takes a certain
circuit, and wounds the trees. Then, a couple
of years afterwards he wanders that way, and reaps
his harvest. There&rsquo;s another industry that gives
employment to lots of men up here. That&rsquo;s gathering
hoop poles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! tell us something about that,&rdquo; demanded
Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Allan went on, &ldquo;he follows in the wake
of the logger, you might say, for he just wants the
second growth that springs up around the stumps
left after the tree is cut down. He takes what no
one else seems to want, the young birch and ash
sprouts that are too plentiful anyway.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He takes a horse with him on his tours, for he
has lots to tote. He hauls his day&rsquo;s cutting to
camp, and spends the evening fixing the poles. It&rsquo;s
pretty hard work, I&rsquo;m told, all around; but then the
evenings are pleasant, what with the crackle of the
fire; the swish of the shaves at work taking the bark
off the poles; the pipe-smoking; and the story-telling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do they get for the poles after they&rsquo;ve
been skinned?&rdquo; asked Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About two or three cents apiece, but that pays
well for their work, and they bring in a heap of stuff
through a winter. Of course, you know that these
poles are split later, and used for barrels, the smaller
ones for nail kegs, and to put around boxes. Down
South all the orange boxes have such bindings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all the ways of earning a living up here
in this wonderful country?&rdquo; Thad asked, deeply
interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say decidedly not,&rdquo; replied the other.
&ldquo;Why, I couldn&rsquo;t begin to tell you the different
things men do up here, besides acting as guides;
fire wardens, to protect the woods; and logging.
There&rsquo;s the professional honey hunter who spends
most of his time summers in locating bee trees.
Then there&rsquo;s the axe-handle man. He needs ash of
a larger growth than the hoop-pole fellow. The
trees are chopped in the fall, and then by means of
a &lsquo;froe&rsquo; and an axe, each handle is shaped out in
a rough state. Then they are buried, that they may
season without cracking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How funny that is,&rdquo; said Bumpus, who was
listening to all this with eager ears.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>&ldquo;For fear that the wood may split,&rdquo; continued
Allan, &ldquo;each end is daubed with a paint which is
part grease; because ash goes to pieces mighty easy,
if the sun gets at it. The rough handles are sent
away to a factory to be nicely finished. Then there&rsquo;s
the fellow who hunts for ship knees; and I tell you
he has no picnic. I tried it once, and I give you my
word I don&rsquo;t want to go out again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ship knees!&rdquo; echoed Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and there are heaps of these picked up, but
only after tough work. The prospector goes out
with his axe, hunting for hack or back juniper, or
tamarack. He must examine every one he finds to
make sure it has just the right kind of a bend or
crook; and then comes the job of digging it out,
which is a muscle racking business, believe me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any more?&rdquo; demanded Bumpus, when Allen
paused to finish his coffee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! yes, lots. I remember the fellow who goes
after hemlock bark for the tanneries. Then there
are the Indians who make baskets: or who prefer to
have the old style birch bark canoe, to one of these
elegant up-to-date canvas ones, that are built on exactly
the same model as those used hundreds of
years ago. Big birches are few and far between up
in Maine now, and sometimes, as Sebattis here has
told me, one of the Penobscots will travel nearly
fifty miles before he can strike a tree large enough
to make a canoe, yielding a piece of bark without a
crack, or a knot-hole, where a branch has been
lopped off.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That winds up the list, then, does it?&rdquo; asked
Step Hen, getting up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Far from it,&rdquo; laughed Allen. &ldquo;I could sit here
for half an hour more, and tell you about other
queer occupations that these wonderful Maine
woods open up to the men who have a leaning that
way. Why, I understand that some smart fellows
have even been dredging some of the streams after
the mussels or fresh water clams; and not only selling
the shells to the factories where pearl buttons
are manufactured, but finding pearls every little
while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pearls, and up here of all places!&rdquo; exclaimed
Bumpus, as though amazed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied Allen. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been taking
a great many out in the streams of Indiana,
Missouri and other states in the middle West these
years back, and one man in the Moosehead region in
Maine found a pearl not long ago that brought two
hundred dollars, and was worth many times that
when polished, I guess. And then, last but not least,
are the trappers who are scattered all over the state.
Each winter they take a tremendous amount of valuable
fur; and as Maine is so far north, the pelts
being several times as much as those in warmer
countries. A muskrat hide from a swamp up here,
is worth three times as much as one taken in Florida
or Louisiana. But some other time I may tell you
more about the resources of these great woods. It&rsquo;s
time we got busy doing things; and here are Thad
and Davy just waiting to be moving on their little
hunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I declare,&rdquo; remarked Bumpus, &ldquo;I never
had any idea the woods up here had such a lot of
living in &rsquo;em for an army of men,&rdquo; and he looked
around at the encircling trees with renewed respect.</p>
<p>The little hunting party was soon ready to launch
forth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be back before night, I suppose?&rdquo; bawled
out Giraffe after them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We expect to,&rdquo; replied Thad; &ldquo;but if we hold
off, make your minds up we&rsquo;re all right, and don&rsquo;t
let Bumpus worry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! just as if Bumpus didn&rsquo;t have enough to
worry about as it is,&rdquo; grumbled the fat boy. &ldquo;I
dreamed last night that when I got back to Cranford
I found all my folks lined up at the station, and
every blessed one apointin&rsquo; an accusin&rsquo; finger right at
me, an&rsquo; lookin&rsquo; real sad. Say, I woke up all of a
tremble, and was mighty glad to find that it was only
a silly dream. Course I must a delivered that note
to the bank; chances they&rsquo;re ten to one I did; <i>but I
wish I knew; I just wish I could be dead sure</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>He was a bit gloomy all through the morning, and
sat there staring into the red heart of the fire until
Giraffe demanded to know whether he was sick; and
if he meant to go out with them after lunch to hunt
for that bee tree, or keep camp.</p>
<p>That seemed to excite Bumpus, and he again forgot
all his troubles. But evidently his pondering
had not brought any happy result; and he was just
as far as ever from knowing whether he had carried
out his father&rsquo;s instructions with regard to that
precious letter, or not.</p>
<p>The sun had indeed warmed things up toward
noon. It often does during the fall season in
Maine, and before the first heavy snow, making ideal
weather; the early morning being crisp and delightful,
with the middle of the day quite warm.</p>
<p>Allan had admitted that if ever they had a chance
to find a bee tree that day ought to tell the tale. He
believed that the young bees would surely be tempted
to take some exercise before they were hived up for
the long winter. And when there is a swarm buzzing
around busily in a clump, they make quite some
noise, that a keen ear can easily detect, if on guard.</p>
<p>So, after they had partaken of a light lunch, they
started out, leaving Sebattis to look after the camp
while they were gone.</p>
<p>Besides an axe, the boys carried a few things in
which a supply of honey could be brought back, in
case success followed their efforts, and a genuine
bee tree was located.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>Allan told them the comforting truth, that since
this region had apparently not been hunted over
for some years, there ought to be a very good chance
of running across a hive. Of course they carried
their guns, because no one could tell when these
useful articles would be needed. And as Jim said,
&ldquo;when a man wants his gun, he gen&rsquo;rally needs it in
a big hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they went along Allan took occasion to point
out numerous things that bore some relation to the
facts which he had so recently been telling them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a birch almost big enough to make a
canoe,&rdquo; he remarked, pointing to a splendid specimen
of the shapely tree that stood close by. &ldquo;And
over yonder is a tamarack on the border of that
swale. You generally find them in swampy sections.
And around this tree blown down by a storm, you
can see growing a lot of young shoots, which, as
like as not, the hoop pole man would cut for his
use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently, however, he began to explain how they
must stretch out, forming a line through the woods,
and covering the ground. At one end Allen himself
took up his station, with Jim the guide forming the
other guard. This was a precaution, lest one of the
others showed an inclination to stray. They were
to keep in touch with one another by occasional
shouts, which were to serve as signals. Each one
had his particular and distinguishing call, and when
Allen shouted, first Bumpus, next in line, then Step
Hen, and after him Giraffe and Jim were to answer
in order; that the one in charge could be sure that
they were keeping in something of a straight line.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>And in case a hum was heard that sounded like a
hive, a certain cry, twice repeated, was to summon
all the others to the spot.</p>
<p>The boys tramped for half an hour, with eyes and
ears on the alert. Many times no doubt they imagined
they caught the welcome buzzing sound, but
upon coming to a halt in order to listen and make
certain, before bringing their companions hurrying
to the spot, it always devolved into something else,
much to the chagrin and disappointment of the
hunter.</p>
<p>Bumpus was fully awake to the great possibilities
of the occasion. Somehow this honey hunting had
become a sort of mania with him. It was not that
he loved the sweet nectar of the hive any better than
Giraffe for instance; but his nature was such that he
liked to find things that were lost. And somehow
the idea of locating a genuine bee tree appealed immensely
to the fat boy.</p>
<p>So he tramped sturdily along, looking upward
with a great effort, on account of his stout build, and
frequently wishing Nature had endowed him with
that &ldquo;rubber neck&rdquo; which Giraffe boasted, and
which must be an ideal one for a wild honey hunter,
Bumpus imagined. It was perhaps the first and
only time he had ever envied his comrade in the possession
of such a long neck.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>But Bumpus really believed that fortune was going
to be extra kind to him. He kept telling himself
that if any one discovered the wonderful bee tree,
it must be himself, because he had dreamed of it so
very often.</p>
<p>Now and then he answered the calls which Allen
sent out. He did this because he had a horror of
getting lost. These woods seemed everlastingly big
to him; and he could just imagine the terrible condition
that must face any tenderfoot scout who
managed to stray away from contact with his camp
mates.</p>
<p>About three quarters of an hour had gone now,
and as yet no cry announcing the successful find had
come pealing along the line. Bumpus was beginning
to feel tired, without any question. He admitted it
to himself, but grudgingly, for he did not want to
halt the proceedings, now that they were actually
engaged in the bee hunt.</p>
<p>He refreshed himself at every water hole he came
to, whether it were a running brook, or just a tiny
pond with a thin skim of ice along the shore.</p>
<p>They were passing through a rather thick patch
of woods when Bumpus felt another thrill. He felt
certain that he had caught something that sounded
like the buzzing of a swarm of insects; and as he
had more than once meddled with the hive his people
had at home, Bumpus was well qualified to know
what the droning might be like.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>Eagerly did he look upward, all around him.
Then he began to locate the quarter from which it
seemed to come, and in so doing brought to bear
what little woods&rsquo; lore he had managed to pick up;
for he actually noted the direction of the slight
breeze, and how the noise came to him more clearly
as he moved to a certain point.</p>
<p>Finally he believed it must come from one tree in
particular. He made several tests, and each time
his conviction grew more and more positive. And
still the droning kept up. But the tree was a very
tall one, and Bumpus had never trained his eyes to
detecting small objects at a distance. In fact, some
of his friends had even declared that he must be
near-sighted, though he stoutly denied this.</p>
<p>Then suddenly, he saw a confused blur between
himself and the blue sky above the tops of the trees.
It actually moved back and forth in a singular swaying
way.</p>
<p>Bumpus thrilled now with new pride. He fully
believed that in this tall tree of the Maine woods he
had actually located a bee hive that would assure
them all the clarified sweetness they could carry
away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>And when he had made as sure of this as he could,
Bumpus put his trembling hands to his mouth, and
sent out in his loudest tones the call agreed upon to
tell the others that he, Bumpus, had after all been
the one to succeed.</p>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI.
<br /><span class="small">A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE, WELL EARNED.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;A false alarm, boys!&rdquo; sang out the envious
Giraffe, as they all came hurrying up to the spot
where Bumpus was dancing about excitedly, with
a wide grin on his rosy fat face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, hey?&rdquo; declared the discoverer, indignantly;
&ldquo;well, you just wait and see what Allan
here says. There&rsquo;s the tree it&rsquo;s in; and if you put on
your specs, Giraffe, p&rsquo;raps even you c&rsquo;n see the
swarm buzzin&rsquo; around up yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s right, boys,&rdquo; declared Allan, quickly;
&ldquo;even before I look I can hear the noise that
tells the truth. We&rsquo;ve found our bee tree; and the
honor goes after all to our chum, Bumpus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah for Bumpus!&rdquo; exclaimed Step Hen,
pounding the fat scout on the back, after the custom
of boys in general.</p>
<p>They were all soon able to locate the buzzing
sound, and gaped up with growing eagerness at the
place where the swarm was in motion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like a big hive, too,&rdquo; ventured Giraffe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You never can tell,&rdquo; Allan declared; &ldquo;but from
the signs I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if it was an old
one, and just stocked to the doors with honey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow! that suits me,&rdquo; Giraffe went on; &ldquo;I can
stand it every meal, right along. Never yet did get
enough of the stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s awful high up,&rdquo; ventured Step Hen.
&ldquo;How under the sun will we ever climb up there,
and dig it out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t have to,&rdquo; remarked Bumpus, placidly;
&ldquo;that tree&rsquo;s just got to be chopped down, so&rsquo;s to let
us scoop up all the stuff we can carry back home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a whopper of a tree,&rdquo; Step Hen went
on; &ldquo;and who&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to chop it down, I&rsquo;d like to
know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; remarked Bumpus, pleasantly, &ldquo;that was
all fixed long ago. You may remember that once
Giraffe here promised to chop down the tree, if ever
I located a hive. Well, there&rsquo;s the tree; so get busy,
Giraffe. It&rsquo;s a pretty hefty axe, too, I should think;
but you know how to swing one. I&rsquo;ll sit down on
this log, and see how you get on; because I&rsquo;ve done
my part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe started to answer back; then thought better
of it; and seizing hold of the axe that Jim the
guide carried, he started to hack the tree.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>But Giraffe was no woodsman, and made such a
sorry mess of it that Jim finally took pity on him.
He knew the scout would never get that tree down
in a day, judging from the clumsy way he started in.
Besides, there would be danger of the amateur
chopper bringing it down on himself. It takes an
experienced woodsman to judge how a tree is inclined
to fall. One of these fellows can drop a tree
almost in any exact place he wants, unless the slant
of the trunk is entirely too great to be overcome by
judicious work with the axe.</p>
<p>From time to time Allan &ldquo;spelled&rdquo; the guide, for
he knew how to handle an axe to some advantage.
And the others stood around, watching with interest
the clever way in which the sharp axe cut into the
wood, exactly on a line with preceding strokes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could never learn to do that in a coon&rsquo;s age,&rdquo;
admitted Bumpus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I mean to, and before I quit these here
Maine woods,&rdquo; declared Giraffe. &ldquo;A feller that&rsquo;s
as fond of fires as me, ought to know how to chop
down a tree, so&rsquo;s to always have plenty of wood for
burnin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I can see the finish of these grand woods,
after <i>you</i> do learn how,&rdquo; remarked Step Hen, a little
sarcastically. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never rest as long as there&rsquo;s
one tree left to burn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, she&rsquo;s shivering, now; better look out, fellers,
because that tree&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to come down right
soon!&rdquo; called out Bumpus, edging away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>After a little more work Jim made the rest all get
back beyond the danger line, in case the tree did
chance to swing around; which he knew would not
be the case; because Jim had once been a logger,
and doubtless felled hundreds of larger trees than
this one.</p>
<p>With a crash it came plunging down, just where
the man with the axe had said he meant to drop it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoop! Hurrah!&rdquo; shrilled the excited
Bumpus, who held a kettle in his hands; and carried
away by the thrill of the moment, he forgot all the
warning he had received from Allan, plunging
straight toward the upper part of the tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Split wide open, fellers, and oh! my, just look
at the honey spilled all over the ground! What a
wicked waste. Oh! Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come back from there!&rdquo; shouted Jim.</p>
<p>It was too late. Bumpus was in the midst of the
excited swarm of bees that had started to whirl
around, dazed at first by the sudden catastrophe
that had overtaken their house, but rapidly becoming
furiously angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at the silly, would you?&rdquo; cried Step Hen,
staring aghast at Bumpus, who had already started
to fill his receptacle with the honey comb that lay
around, partly broken by the fall of the tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re after him!&rdquo; shrieked Giraffe, who
thought it a comical sight to see the fat boy trying
to gather up the sweet stuff with one hand, while the
other was busily engaged slapping at the insects that
began to get their work in on various parts of his
anatomy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>Finally even the fortitude of Bumpus gave way
before the onslaught of that army of angry bees,
each member of which was armed with a sting that
could make things exceedingly interesting for the
intruder.</p>
<p>So Bumpus began a masterly retreat. At first he
clung to his spoils; and then, finding that he needed
a dozen arms to ward off the savage little insects he
dropped his plunder, and set out on a wild run,
kicking and slapping at a tremendous rate.</p>
<p>Giraffe laughed heartily at the sight. He had advanced
much further than the others, before realizing
that the example of Bumpus was reckless, and
Step Hen&rsquo;s calling warned him to pull up.</p>
<p>In the midst of his merriment Giraffe was seen
to give a vicious lunge at the side of his head; this
was followed by another, and another, as more bees
found him out; until with a yell he too had to seek
safety in flight, his long arms waving every which
way, like flails on a barn floor; or the wings of a
Dutch windmill in action.</p>
<p>It was a pair of very contrite boys that presently
asked Allan&rsquo;s advice as to what was best for bee
stings. Step Hen himself could not keep from
grinning at the enlarged appearance of their heads,
and even gave them some fatherly advice about the
folly of being so conceited, and having such swelled
heads over a little thing like that.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>But Allan found some mud on the border of a
nearby pond, with which he plastered their hurts in
the good old-fashioned way known to the early
pioneers. After which there were two of the most
comical looking fellows ever seen wearing the uniform
of Boy Scouts. All the same, the cool mud did
seem to ease the terrible burning caused by the
stings, and Allan said it would in a measure take
out the poison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more rheumatism cures for me, I tell you,&rdquo;
remarked Giraffe. &ldquo;Whew! I guess the remedy is
some worse than the disease. And can&rsquo;t those little
beggars just poke it into you, though? Every time
one stung me, I felt like he was pushing a six-inch
knife into me, and heated red hot at that. Honey,
oh! yes, I like you; but I&rsquo;d rather buy it in the
market after this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t think of giving up so soon,&rdquo; remarked
Step Hen. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m dead sure Allan here knows of a
way to get all the honey we want, and never be
stung once, don&rsquo;t you, Allan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you how it&rsquo;s done,&rdquo; replied the other,
&ldquo;though in the summer time the bee hunters often
carry a piece of mosquito netting along, which they
fasten over their hats, so the insects can&rsquo;t get at
them. But there&rsquo;s another way. Bees are in deadly
fear of smoke. All bee men give them a few puffs
of smoke before they open the hive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does that do, stupefy the poor little critters?&rdquo;
asked Step Hen, who did not know as much
about bees as even Bumpus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you see,&rdquo; volunteered the latter, wishing
to air his knowledge, &ldquo;bees, as soon as they scent
smoke, believe their hive is on fire. Every feller
gets busy right away, loading up with honey. And
when they&rsquo;re doing that, they won&rsquo;t take any notice
of other things, so they c&rsquo;n be handled easy enough.
I know somethin&rsquo; &rsquo;bout bees, because we got a new
fangled hive at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! I just guess you know more about &rsquo;em
right now than ever you did before, Bumpus,&rdquo;
chuckled Step Hen, who had not been stung once;
&ldquo;and it&rsquo;s been impressed on you pretty strong, too,
so&rsquo;s to keep you from forgettin&rsquo; the same. After
this you ain&rsquo;t agoin&rsquo; to romp into a hive of bees
that&rsquo;s been upset, not in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allan, s&rsquo;pose you get busy with that smoke,&rdquo; remarked
Bumpus, disdaining to appear to notice this
slur on his capacity for bee lore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better wait a little longer,&rdquo; the other advised;
&ldquo;so we can get closer. They&rsquo;ll quiet down in
a little while, and then we can make the fire on the
windward side, so that the smoke must drift right
across the hive.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>Presently he set them to work collecting just the
kind of fuel he wanted, and which was calculated
to make a dense smoke. When this smudge was
started going it seemed to set the bees working with
feverish eagerness to load themselves down with
honey. No one ever has learned just why they do
this, unless it is the desire to save enough food for
self support; because they never attempt to rescue
any of the young brood in the cells.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it near time now?&rdquo; asked the impatient
Bumpus, whom even the swollen condition of his
neck and cheeks did not seem to entirely cure of that
eager desire to snatch the fruits of his victory from
the savage little army of protectors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little longer, and then we can set to work.
Better let Jim and me do the main part of it, boys.
You might be too excited; and it&rsquo;s always that kind
of a fellow the bees tackle. I&rsquo;ve known bee keepers
who handle their hives day in and day out all season,
and seldom get a sting. They&rsquo;re cool, and never
make a false move, such as knocking the box, or
coughing, or any sort of sound that will anger the
insects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went on to tell them some interesting facts
connected with the finding of bee trees, which he
had either heard from the lips of others, or witnessed
himself.</p>
<p>Ten minutes passed, and Bumpus was growing
impatient again, when Allan remarked:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, the time is up, I guess; and if you keep
back of us, and hand us the buckets, Jim and myself
can begin to get some of that clear stuff, which looks
like this season&rsquo;s make. It won&rsquo;t take only a little
time till we fill everything we brought, and there
must be a ton of the stuff, all told, in this big old
hive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even Giraffe forgot his late unpleasantness as he
again advanced nearer the spot where the stores of
scattered sweetness lay.</p>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII.
<br /><span class="small">THE COMING OF THE HAIRY HONEY THIEF.</span></h2>
<p>It did not take long for the honey gatherers to
fill every receptacle they had brought along with
them. Bumpus was once more feeling a little like
himself, though Step Hen did take occasion to warn
him against showing his pride over being the one to
find the bee tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honors are about even, I guess, Bumpus,&rdquo; he
would remark, with stinging emphasis; &ldquo;you found
the bees, and they found you, all right, looks like.
And you&rsquo;re swelled up enough now without letting
yourself puff out any more. We all admit that
you&rsquo;re a wonder, and that you&rsquo;ve sure got an eye for
bee trees; just as Giraffe here is crazy about the
stuff. Look at him now, would you, munching at
that comb just like it was a slice of bread and jam.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yum! yum!&rdquo; remarked the person in question,
whose face was smeared almost up to his ears with
the sticky stuff; &ldquo;ain&rsquo;t had such a delicious feed
since I sneaked into the preserve closet at home
when a kid, and the spring lock caught. I knew
I&rsquo;d be in for a tannin&rsquo; and was bound to get the
worth of it first, so I just ate and ate, tryin&rsquo; to
sample every kind there was. It made me sick
though, which was worse than the strappin&rsquo; my dad
gave me. But this is the finest ever, barring none.
Yum! yum! and more to follow, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if I was like that, I&rsquo;d just camp out alongside
this old nest, till I&rsquo;d scraped it clean, if it took
all winter,&rdquo; declared Step Hen; who did not happen
to care particularly for sweet things, and therefore
felt no sympathy for the other pair of scouts.</p>
<p>Bumpus had also tasted his find, and pronounced
it prime. They could hardly coax Giraffe away
from the fallen bee tree; and in securing a last comb
of the lovely clear honey, he managed to get a few
more stings that rather added to his ridiculous appearance.
Step Hen nearly took a fit every time he
looked at that pair, nor could Allan blame him; for
they certainly were a sight calculated to make any
one forget all his own troubles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>The afternoon wore away, and those who remained
in camp talked over the next thing which
was on the programme. This was nothing more
nor less than making an effort to bag a bear; and of
course Giraffe was particularly interested, because
of the boast he had made in Cranford that he did
not mean to return home until he had, alone and unaided,
shot a black bear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was sure enough smell of honey in the
air around that old bee tree to set a bear crazy for a
taste, if he ever got wind of the treat,&rdquo; declared
Allan, when Giraffe asked him for the fifth time
about the chances they had of meeting with Bruin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe he&rsquo;s over there now, fillin&rsquo; up?&rdquo; suggested
Bumpus, who was not very much interested,
because he could not be coaxed to go all the way
back to where they had secured their store of sweets,
even though sure of seeing a bear diving into the
honey tree, and stowing away great quantities of
the sticky stuff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t likely he&rsquo;s abroad in the daytime,&rdquo;
Allan replied. &ldquo;He got something of a scare when
we chased him out of here, and I guess he&rsquo;s lying
snug in some old hollow, where he can take up his
quarters for the winter. But when night comes, I
think he&rsquo;ll venture out; and once he does, he&rsquo;ll sniff
that scent a mile away; for a bear, like all wild animals,
has a great nose for odors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we don&rsquo;t need to go out till after supper?&rdquo;
suggested Giraffe. &ldquo;Glad about that, too,
because I&rsquo;m some tired.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I should think you would be,&rdquo; Step Hen put in,
maliciously; &ldquo;after that great sprint you did when
the little busy bees tried to hand you their cards.
If you could only make that fast time in a schoolboy
race, you&rsquo;d be a wonder, Giraffe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! glad you think so, Step Hen,&rdquo; grunted
the other.</p>
<p>Time passed on. The afternoon waned, and supper
was cooking; but as yet the absent scouts, with
old Eli along, had not returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use waiting for &rsquo;em any longer, fellers,&rdquo;
remarked Giraffe, who, as the shadows gathered,
was anxious to be off, for fear lest the bear get to
the honey tree, and secure a full supply before they
arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyhow, we need not be bothered about Thad
who knows how to get around, even if he has to
stay out all night,&rdquo; declared Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides, they&rsquo;ve got old Eli along; and what he
don&rsquo;t know about the Maine woods you could put in
a thimble,&rdquo; remarked Bumpus, not at all averse to
attacking the supper Jim had cooked, and which
seemed to have a splendid odor.</p>
<p>Accordingly, they sat down, and hurried through
the meal. Giraffe kept urging Allan and Jim to
hurry up, and in consequence they were all done
before it was actually dark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>Giraffe took special pains to look his big rifle over
before starting, for he wanted to be able to depend
on it when the time came for business. Doubtless
the boy could not quite forget the slurs that had
been cast on his father&rsquo;s weapon, when the new up-to-date
repeater, with its mushroom bullets, had
given such a good account of itself, at the time of the
killing of the moose; and he was fully determined
that he would equal the score Thad had set, if given
a chance.</p>
<p>Jim declared he could lead them straight to the
fallen bee tree, and Allan seemed to put full confidence
in the guide. So they set forth.</p>
<p>Sebattis, Step Hen and Bumpus was left behind,
to guard the camp and the canoes.</p>
<p>Perhaps it would seem a long way to Giraffe, for
he had gone through considerable since daybreak.
And those bee stings must have robbed him of more
or less energy. But the prospect of big game
buoyed up his spirits, and he trudged along with the
other two, changing his heavy gun occasionally
from one shoulder to the other, in order to rest himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smells pretty strong of honey, I must say,&rdquo; he
muttered, after they had been moving quite some
time.</p>
<p>This was doubtless intended to be put out as a
&ldquo;feeler;&rdquo; and it worked well too, for Allan immediately
remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nearly there, Giraffe; a few minutes more, and
you&rsquo;ll see the tree we cut down.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;ye think he c&rsquo;n be there?&rdquo; whispered the long
scout, nervously fingering the lock of his rifle, as he
peered ahead into the gloom of the night, possibly
seeing a bear rearing up on his hind legs, every time
he caught sight of a dim tree before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim says no, he hasn&rsquo;t come yet,&rdquo; replied
Allan, also allowing his voice to sink; for although
they were coming up to windward of the bee tree,
it was better to be doubly cautious.</p>
<p>Presently they arrived on the spot, and found
all quiet. Bruin had evidently not reached the
scene, though both Jim and Allan were just as positive
as ever that the old fellow would be along before
a great while.</p>
<p>So Jim selected the place where they would lie in
wait. It was close enough to the broken bee hive
to afford Giraffe a splendid chance for a shot.
Allan had made sure to fetch along the little electric
hand torch belonging to Thad. This he meant to
manipulate himself, and believed it would be all that
was necessary to catch the attention of the honey-eating
bear, and hold him in surprise until Giraffe
could take aim, and pull trigger.</p>
<p>After that they had to remain very quiet indeed,
lest some incautious movement warn the bear of
their presence. Jim had seen to it that both the boys
had dressed warmly, even donning sweaters for the
occasion; since it is a shivery job to sit for one or
more hours of a cold night, hardly daring to move.
The blood seems to become congealed in the veins
with the inaction; and once a shiver passes over the
frame, the teeth start to chattering even against all
will power.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>When an hour had gone, Giraffe began to grow
tired. He was more or less apt to show impatience,
at any rate, and had not learned the lesson of controlling
his boyish desire to have things happen
quickly.</p>
<p>Allan was just on his left, holding the torch ready
for action; and by leaning that way Giraffe could
speak in the lowest of whispers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is gettin&rsquo; tough,&rdquo; he admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep standing it a while longer,&rdquo; came in reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But do you really think he&rsquo;ll come along yet?&rdquo;
asked Giraffe, disconsolately, as he pictured Bumpus
and Step Hen sitting so snugly beside the glowing
fire he loved so much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both Jim and I think the chances are the old
fellow&rsquo;s on the way right now,&rdquo; answered the comforter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, then, I&rsquo;ll just try to stand it a while
longer; but I hope my hands don&rsquo;t tremble this way
when I come to shoot,&rdquo; Giraffe went on to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your gun resting on the log, just like I
showed you,&rdquo; said Allan. &ldquo;That way it won&rsquo;t
much matter if you are shivering. And be sure and
shoot just as soon as you&rsquo;re certain you&rsquo;ve got his
shoulder covered. I won&rsquo;t butt in unless I think he&rsquo;s
going to get away. Now, close up again, Giraffe.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>Silence once more rested on the scene. More
minutes passed by&mdash;five, ten, fifteen dragging along.</p>
<p>Giraffe was just about to touch Allan on the arm
again, and tell him he really could not stand it, he
was so cold, when he heard a strange little sound
that made him forget all about it. In a second, it
seemed, his heart got to pounding away at such a
lively rate that he actually felt hot all over.</p>
<p>Was that a real &ldquo;sniff, sniff&rdquo; that came to his
ears? He strained his hearing, and caught it more
plainly now; and besides, he could detect a shuffling
sound, such as would indicate the presence of a
large body moving along.</p>
<p>It approached the scene of the wrecked tree hive;
and a minute later, while Giraffe almost held his
breath with anxiety, he caught other sounds that
told him the hairy honey thief had set to work gulping
down the scattered combs so full of sweetness,
with a greed that even excelled his own love for
the product of the hive.</p>
<p>Apparently it was about time something were doing,
unless they meant to allow the bear to fill himself
with the honey, in the hope that while in this
condition he might fall an easier prey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>Then came a nudge in the side from Allan.
Giraffe knew what this meant. He had been warned
that when the time for action had arrived Allan
would give him such a dig; and that he was to prepare
to take aim and fire, for the little electric torch
would flash immediately afterward.</p>
<p>All of a sudden the bear gave a snort. The intense
darkness had been dispelled by a brilliant ray
of light. Well had Allan judged the location of the
honey thief, for Giraffe could instantly see the bear
standing there, with upraised head, staring straight
toward the point from whence that mysterious light
sprang.</p>
<p>His side was fortunately toward them. Giraffe
thought it looked almost as big as the famous red
barn; and as he glanced along the extended barrel
of his father&rsquo;s rifle he tried to control his nerves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot!&rdquo; came in a shrill whisper from Allan,
who feared lest the other might be so panic stricken
that he could not pull trigger.</p>
<p>And obeying the injunction, Giraffe did shoot,
the crash of the rifle being almost immediately
drowned in a terrible roar that burst forth.</p>
<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII.
<br /><span class="small">A MIGHTY NIMROD.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Again! give him another shot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe heard this shouted close to his ear, and
mechanically working the pump action of the heavy
repeating rifle which his father had carried for quite
some years on his hunting trips up in the Adirondacks,
he again fired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Once more, quick! you&rsquo;ve got him going; but
he&rsquo;s getting up again!&rdquo; cried Allan, and so Giraffe
did as he was told.</p>
<p>Then he did not see the black hairy mass move
any more, though he could hardly believe that he had
done what he had expressed such a great ambition to
accomplish&mdash;shoot a real black bear in his native
wilds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! you&rsquo;ve finished him, Giraffe!&rdquo; exclaimed
Allan, reaching for the quivering hand of his chum,
which he squeezed most heartily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ever so
glad I didn&rsquo;t have to butt in, and spoil it all. That&rsquo;s
your game for keeps, Giraffe. You&rsquo;ve got to cut a
notch in the stock of your gun after this, because
you&rsquo;re no longer a greenhorn. Come along, and
let&rsquo;s see what he looks like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bear was undoubtedly dead. That last bullet
had evidently finished him, although very likely he
would never have left that spot after receiving the
first and second shots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! but ain&rsquo;t he a buster, though?&rdquo; ejaculated
the delighted hunter, as he cautiously felt of
one of the forepaws of the animal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to get him out of this before morning,&rdquo;
said Allan; &ldquo;because the bees will be apt to
make it good and warm for us, if we poke in here
by daylight. Let&rsquo;s all get hold, and see if we can&rsquo;t
budge the old critter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They found it all they were able to do, to move
the bear a few inches at a time; but once clear of the
branches of the trees, the task proved easier. By
throwing all their weight into each pull, as Jim
sang out: &ldquo;yo heave-o!&rdquo; they finally managed to
get the prize where they wanted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about leaving him here through the night,
Jim?&rdquo; asked Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d say as how it war safe, if it hadn&rsquo;t be&rsquo;n fur
thet howl we heard last night,&rdquo; replied the guide.
&ldquo;If so be wolves is aroun&rsquo;, they&rsquo;d clean up this carcase
right smart between now an&rsquo; daylight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! but I want that hide the worst kind,&rdquo; declared
Giraffe. &ldquo;Why, whoever&rsquo;d believe me, if I
couldn&rsquo;t show the skin of the bear I shot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim took out his knife, and felt the edge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody make a fire, so I kin see, and we&rsquo;ll
fix things afore a hour goes past,&rdquo; he said, simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me do it, Allan; you know nobody knows
how to build fires as well as I do!&rdquo; Giraffe exclaimed,
laying his gun aside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>He was as good as his word, and had a splendid
fire working inside of a very few minutes. The
Maine guide was already busily engaged, and Giraffe
watched him taking the bear&rsquo;s hide off with more
than common interest; for was it not <i>his</i> bear, and
did he not have the right to feel proud? Why, if he
had shot poorly, the big beast, rendered savage
through pain, might have charged the party; and
then there would have been plenty of excitement.
Even Allan might have missed, since he could hardly
manage to see while trying to hold the torch, and
his rifle at the same time; and there would be no
telling what must have happened.</p>
<p>After Jim had very deftly taken the hide off, he
started in to carve up some of the carcase, taking the
choicest portions; for they could only carry a certain
amount with them, and the wolves or foxes were
quite welcome to the balance.</p>
<p>Indeed, from the grin on Jim&rsquo;s face, as he used his
knife, Allan fancied that the bear was bound to
prove about as tough as the moose. But then, hungry
boys can masticate what would prove a difficult
task to one whose teeth were less sharp; and besides,
as that was Giraffe&rsquo;s bear; of course it would taste
especially fine to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d I hit him, Jim?&rdquo; Giraffe asked, after
a time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One shot took him on the shoulder,&rdquo; said Allan,
before the guide could reply. &ldquo;I think that must
have been your first. It kind of knocked him over.
Then, as he was getting up again, you gave him a
second clean through the heart. He kicked after
that, but could never have done you any hurt. That
was a dandy shot, fired at the time he was moving,
too. The last one came in his side, and didn&rsquo;t
amount to so much. But taken in all, you did finely,
Giraffe. It speaks well for your nerve.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; grunted the other, who was plainly
pleased by Allan&rsquo;s words nevertheless; &ldquo;they always
did own I had plenty of nerve, you know. Eli Bangs
said I had, when I stepped up and took his best girl
away from him at that school dance we held out in
Epply&rsquo;s big barn last winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got enough, Jim?&rdquo; asked Allan, as the guide
wiped his knife, and put it back in the leather sheath
at his belt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All we kin kerry,&rdquo; replied the other, &ldquo;an&rsquo; p&rsquo;raps
twice as much as we&rsquo;ll eat, I reckons. If so be them
wolves is still around, let &rsquo;em come ter the feast.
I&rsquo;d like ter git a crack at one of the critters, myself.
A wolf I never yet shot, &rsquo;cause you see, they be&rsquo;n so
skeerce ever sence I got to totin&rsquo; a gun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we might as well head back to the cabin,&rdquo;
Allan remarked. &ldquo;I see you&rsquo;ve made that up in two
packs, Jim&mdash;the hide in one, and the meat in the
other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep, I thort as how <i>he&rsquo;d</i> like to kerry the skin,
&rsquo;cause it&rsquo;s his&rsquo;n; I&rsquo;ll tackle the bundle o&rsquo; bear meat,&rdquo;
and the guide slung the heavy load up across his back
with the air of one accustomed to making trips
across many a <i>carry</i>, toting boats, duffle and bedding,
as well as tents.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, that leaves the three guns to me; and
if either of you get tired, why, just call on me
to take a turn. You&rsquo;ll find me willing,&rdquo; said
Allan.</p>
<p>But that did not happen. Jim was tough, and accustomed
to doing all sorts of burden bearing in his
work as a guide, summer and winter, year in and
year out. And as for Giraffe, catch him asking anybody
else to lug <i>his</i> bearskin along, so long as he
was able to put one foot before the other.</p>
<p>He may have grunted from time to time; but
when Allan asked if he wanted any assistance
Giraffe indignantly denied being weary. And so he
carried that heavy green hide all the way to camp.</p>
<p>When they arrived at the cabin they could see by
the light through the window that those within still
kept the fire going, evidently anticipating the arrival
of the bear hunting expedition. They jumped up as
the three new arrivals entered, and seeing their
packs, with the long black hair of the pelt showing
plainly, Step Hen and Bumpus were especially vociferous
in their congratulations.</p>
<p>Allan noticed one thing as soon as he had taken
his first peep into the cabin. This was that Thad,
Davy and Eli had not come back as yet. But he saw
no reason to be worried. Thad had taken the pains
to notify them that possibly he and his companions
might be away longer than a single day; and if they
failed to show up after night set in, perhaps they
would stay out a second day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That settles one thing, anyway,&rdquo; remarked
Bumpus. &ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t going to starve, as long as we
have such mighty hunters as Thad and Giraffe along
with us; even if the meat is tough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It settles a number of things,&rdquo; remarked Giraffe,
fastening his &ldquo;eagle eye,&rdquo; as Bumpus liked to term
those orbs of the tall scout, severely on Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I know what you&rsquo;re talkin&rsquo; of now,&rdquo; declared
the other, quickly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about that rifle
of your dad&rsquo;s, an&rsquo; how it c&rsquo;n shoot. Now, I never
said that it couldn&rsquo;t do the trick, all right. Goodness
knows it&rsquo;s heavy enough for anything. It was
you always pokin&rsquo; fun at my little thirty-thirty, and
callin&rsquo; it a popgun, a squirtgun, and all such things.
But I take notice, with all that&rsquo;s said, it took just
three bullets for you to kill that poor bear, that was
nearly ready to turn up his toes, an&rsquo; die from old
age; when Thad, he just fired once, and gave a bull
moose in a fighting frame, his walking papers. And
think how much easier to tote a light gun like mine
twenty miles a day. Ask Jim here, and he&rsquo;ll tell you
he means to get one like mine the next time he finds
thirty dollars in the road.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose that bear is tough, but don&rsquo;t you say
a thing about him being so old he would have soon
kicked the bucket You know better than that, Step
Hen. Don&rsquo;t all of us believe that this is the same
bear we chased out&rsquo;n the cabin here, only last night;
and say, what did he do to you and Bumpus? Seems
to me you wanted us all to know that you&rsquo;d been
thrown ten or twenty feet outside the door, when
that poor weakly old sinner as you call him, just
breezed past you. Now, that will be quite enough
from you, Step Hen. The tougher he was, the more
glory for the feller that shot him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this broadside from Giraffe the other scout
relapsed into silence; indeed, he could find nothing
to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; pretty late, seems to me,&rdquo; Bumpus
remarked, with a yawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is, for kids,&rdquo; added Giraffe, a little contemptuously;
for somehow Step Hen had aroused
his fighting blood and he seemed to have a chip
on his shoulder, daring any one to knock it off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s the use waitin&rsquo; up to see if Thad gets
back?&rdquo; argued the short scout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use at all,&rdquo; remarked Allan, just
then; &ldquo;because I think I hear them coming along
right now. How about it, Sebattis?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three come, Thad, Davy, Eli,&rdquo; replied the
Indian, gravely; for Allan had first had his attention
called to the slight sounds without by noticing that
Sebattis was sitting with his head cocked in a listening
attitude.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to understand how he knows that,&rdquo; muttered
Giraffe, who had edged over toward the corner
where his gun stood, as though a little suspicious
of the identity of those who were even now at the
door; for he remembered that there were exactly
three of those lawless hoboes loose in the woods,
and not far away.</p>
<p>But immediately the door opened, to admit Thad;
and after him came Davy; while the weather-beaten
face of the old Maine guide, Eli Crooks, showed up
in the rear.</p>
<p>Each of the three hunters carried some sort of
burden, though not of any great size, Allan noticed.
These they tossed down in a corner, with the air of
being more or less tired from a long tramp.</p>
<p>And Allan, accustomed to reading faces more
than might the average boy, believed that he saw
something like a frown upon all three countenances,
that certainly must have been caused by something
besides fatigue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Venison?&rdquo; questioned Giraffe, just itching to
have the newcomers ask what luck had fallen to the
share of the bee hunters, when he could hold up that
prized bearskin, and tell how he alone had shot the
monster Bruin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, what little of it was left to us,&rdquo; replied
Davy, crossly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, whatever happened?&rdquo; demanded Bumpus.
&ldquo;I wonder now, did you run across any of those
savage wolves we heard howling last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! not much,&rdquo; replied Thad, smiling; &ldquo;that
would have been a picnic&mdash;for us. But we had an
experience that beat that all hollow. Fact is, we
were fired at by some of those hoboes who are up
here in the woods for their health, and safety!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX.
<br /><span class="small">THE &ldquo;WHINE&rdquo; OF A BULLET.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Wow! and again I say, wow!&rdquo; broke out
Giraffe, although rather feebly; for the astounding
admission made by Thad seemed to have almost
taken his breath away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fired&mdash;on&mdash;by&mdash;the&mdash;hobo burglars?&rdquo; gasped
Bumpus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds kind of interestin&rsquo;, Thad; s&rsquo;pose you tell
us more about it?&rdquo; suggested Step Hen; who,
strange to say, appeared to treat the matter in a less
serious vein than any of his companions.</p>
<p>Sebattis had raised his head at hearing what the
newcomer said, and was evidently taking note; Jim
shut his teeth hard together, and assumed what he
no doubtless believed to be his &ldquo;fighting face&rdquo;; and
he certainly looked fierce enough, Bumpus thought,
happening to glance that way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s have a bite to eat, first, and after
that&rsquo;s done with, I&rsquo;ll tell you all there is to the story,&rdquo;
declared Thad, who was evidently &ldquo;some tired,&rdquo; as
Giraffe liked to put it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>Then there <i>was</i> a hustle, as every one tried to do
something about the fire, so as to hurry things along;
for it became evident that Thad was in no humor to
talk until he had refreshed the inner man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of you fellers go back and sit down;
there&rsquo;s quite too many cooks around here, and it
hinders things more than it helps. Jim and me c&rsquo;n
get along faster if left alone,&rdquo; and with these words
Giraffe &ldquo;shooed&rdquo; Step Hen and Davy into the
background.</p>
<p>Presently the coffee was boiling, and there was a
scent of cooking food in the air. While the three
returned hunters were munching their supper the
others hovered around. Seconds seemed like minutes
to them; while the latter took on the shape of
long hours, so impatient were the boys to hear what
had happened.</p>
<p>But after a time Thad announced that he was
satisfied; and assuming a comfortable attitude, he
started in to talk, the others hanging on his every
word, and frequently interrupting to ask questions,
when a certain point was not wholly understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We tramped all morning, and never started any
game worth bagging,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;Of course, there
were partridges, and if we hadn&rsquo;t been out after deer
we might have brought in a good-sized bag of the
birds. But you know how it is&mdash;when you&rsquo;ve got
your mind made up to have venison, these other
things only annoy you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; remarked Giraffe, &ldquo;partridges
are mighty fine eating; and I&rsquo;m going to bring in a
bunch some of these fine days, if Davy&rsquo;ll loan me
his gun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As yet nothing had been said about the bee tree,
or the black thief Giraffe had bagged; and the boy
was holding the news back, in order to spring it on
the deer hunters, in order to show them that they
were not the only ones who had met with an adventure
since sun-up that morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At nooning,&rdquo; Thad went on to say, paying no
attention to the interruption, for he knew the failings
of Giraffe only too well; &ldquo;we stopped to eat
our snack, and figure out which way we wanted to
tramp between then and night. Eli had his mind
set on getting a deer, and all of us were willing to
stay out till we had dropped one, even if it took all
of to-morrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then once more we made a start, changing our
course, and intending to cover a larger territory, by
making a big sweep. And about three in the afternoon
we managed to start up a nice fat young buck,
which fell to our rifles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davy was seen making motions with his hands
just at this juncture, and the others had little difficulty
in reading the signs to mean that in reality
the said fat young buck had fallen to the rifle of
the speaker, Thad, himself; and if the others could
claim any share in the glory, it was small indeed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We hung the prize up,&rdquo; Thad went on, &ldquo;intending
to come back for him a couple of hours later;
since Eli had an idea we might scare up another
deer in the country just beyond; and Davy was
wild for a chance to try his buckshot cartridges on
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it wasn&rsquo;t any use,&rdquo; broke in Davy just
then. &ldquo;We just tramped and tramped till even Eli
said there didn&rsquo;t seem to be any more deer moving
just then. Besides, I complained of sore feet; and
I guess that was one reason why the others determined
to turn back, pick up our young buck, and
strike for home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The place where we had left the deer was about
seven miles from here, down the wind,&rdquo; Thad continued;
&ldquo;and we just knew that with that tramp
ahead, carrying what we wanted of the deer, it
would take us a good time to get here. But no matter,
we headed straight for the spot which Eli had
marked down in his mind as being the big tree, to
a limb of which we had hoisted our game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the way, Davy, who had changed his shells,
knocked over a couple of partridges very neatly.
They are in one of those bundles there. I only mention
this fact because Eli believes that the discharge
of the double-barrel gun had something to do with
what followed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty soon we came in sight of the big tree; at
least it looked mighty like the one we meant to find;
but we had to rub our eyes, and look again; for do
you know, there wasn&rsquo;t any deer at all hanging
there? Eli said he had made no mistake, and Davy
was as sure as I was that it must be our tree all
right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just then one of us discovered that there was
something lying at the foot of the tree, that had the
look of a deer, and we hurried forward. Davy
hadn&rsquo;t forgotten about the wolves we heard howling,
and was saying that they must have dragged
the buck down in some way. But Eli knew better,
and that it could not be the work of any wolf that
ever trotted on four legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we came closer, and saw a sight that
made us furious,&rdquo; Thad went on, a frown on his
usually placid brow. &ldquo;There was our lovely little
buck, all carved up as fine as you please, and by one
who knew just how to do the business, too. The
best pieces had been carried away, and we were left
only what might have done for the foxes or
wolves!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; burst out the impulsive Giraffe, &ldquo;say,
that was enough to make anybody as mad as hops.
I can just see Davy here jumping around like fun.
Of course you looked for a trail, didn&rsquo;t you,
Thad?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That was the very first thing we did,&rdquo; resumed
the other; &ldquo;and there wasn&rsquo;t any trouble about finding
one either; for Eli said they had jumped off in
such a big hurry he just knew they must have heard
Davy&rsquo;s shots, and expected that we were coming
back for our game. Well, there wasn&rsquo;t any use
crying over spilt milk, boys. But we were so much
upset by our misfortune, and so mad at those fellows,
that we just started off on their trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning to hold them up, if only you overtook
the bunch?&rdquo; suggested Bumpus, who was listening
with all eagerness, his eyes round with interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! well, none of us hardly knew what we
meant to do,&rdquo; Thad answered; &ldquo;I rather guess our
only thought just then was to try and recover the
fine venison those two rascals had robbed us of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there wasn&rsquo;t three of them again?&rdquo; asked
Giraffe, quickly; and Thad smiled as he turned
toward the tall scout, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just wondering whether any of you would
notice that, when I said it; but the fact is, there were
only a pair of &rsquo;em; and Eli&rsquo;s about come to the conclusion
the third man must be sick, or badly
wounded. Well, we did start off at a hot pace, Eli
of course doing most of the trailing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But just hold on there, Thad,&rdquo; interrupted Davy
Jones; &ldquo;you know well enough that three separate
times you found the tracks when Eli had lost the
trail; and didn&rsquo;t he say prompt enough that, for a
boy, you certainly did show a heap of smartness?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think we must have followed that trail about
a mile;&rdquo; Thad went on, giving Davy a smile for
his compliment; &ldquo;and it was beginning to get dusk
a little, when all of a sudden a gun banged away,
somewhere ahead, and we heard the whine of a
bullet passing over close above our heads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; and again Davy broke in to express his
own individual feelings in the matter, &ldquo;none of you
fellers ever was shot at, and I just guess now you
can&rsquo;t understand the queer feeling it gives you. I
felt like the pit of my stomach had kind of caved in,
and there was a gnawing just like you have when
you&rsquo;re <i>awful</i> hungry. And when Thad says that
there bullet &lsquo;whined&rsquo; over our heads, he hits the
mark all right, for that&rsquo;s what it sounded like. I
dropped flat on my face in the scrub, and lay as still
as a &rsquo;possum playing dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all dodged some, I imagine,&rdquo; remarked
Thad, with a smile at Davy&rsquo;s words. &ldquo;I know I
found myself behind a tree in pretty short order.
Eli began to creep up, and it seemed rather exciting
about that time. Even Davy and myself started to
advance. And pretty soon there was Eli, calling to
us to come on, because there was no longer any
danger, for the birds had flown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Skipped out, just like that,&rdquo; and Davy, snapped
his fingers contemptuously; &ldquo;all the while we kept
laying low, and trying to see if we could glimpse
anything to bang away at. It was bad luck.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Thad resumed his story by saying,
&ldquo;with the night at hand, and the two venison
thieves a good half mile away by that time, even Eli
saw that it was useless trying to overhaul &rsquo;em. So
we concluded to make our way back to where our
buck had lain, take what we could get of the remains,
and then start by slow stages for the cabin
here. But we had little to say on the way, for it
seemed more like a funeral procession than the return
of a victorious hunting party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll own up I was pretty nigh tuckered
out,&rdquo; admitted Davy. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one reason why Eli
and Thad decided to come along home. Been limpin&rsquo;
the better part of the way, and I guess I&rsquo;ve got a
stone bruise on my heel that don&rsquo;t feel any too fine.
But I&rsquo;ll be all right to-morrow, fellers; and then
just see what we do to them that would take the
bread away from your mouth, if they had the
chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others looked to Thad, as though what Davy
had just said gave them a cue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the game, to go back there in the mornin&rsquo;,
an&rsquo; take up the trail?&rdquo; asked Giraffe, excitedly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This here seems to be the real thing, all wool,
and a yard wide,&rdquo; muttered Bumpus; and then
brightening up, he continued, with increasing earnestness:
&ldquo;and then, if we should find a chance to
capture those slippery rascals, just think what we
could do with all the nice money that&rsquo;s offered for
their apprehension? Didn&rsquo;t our friend the sheriff
say it was a whole thousand, and might be twice
that by now? Count me in, Thad, I want you to
know, if we&rsquo;re going to round up these bank burglars.
You may wonder why I&rsquo;m so fierce about it;
but you forget that my dad is the president of our
bank at Cranford; and who knows but what it
might a been that institution these hoboes looted.
I&rsquo;ve got a personal interest in this matter, and I
ain&rsquo;t going to be left out of any deal either, just
remember that!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX.
<br /><span class="small">A WONDERFUL FIND.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really think they meant to shoot you,
Thad?&rdquo; asked Step Hen, after the fat boy had
quieted down somewhat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been talking that over,&rdquo; the patrol leader
replied; &ldquo;and come to the conclusion that the shot
was only meant as a warning for us to draw up, and
haul off; to tell us that they were desperate men,
and would not stand for any nonsense from a hunting
party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that bullet <i>did</i> whine, I tell you, fellers;&rdquo;
declared Davy, emphatically; &ldquo;no other word would
explain just how it sounded, when she went zipping
past, so close to our heads that we all ducked without
thinkin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And like as not,&rdquo; remarked Allan, who thus
far had taken no part in the discussion, &ldquo;if we start
taking up their trail in the morning, and come anywhere
close to our birds, we&rsquo;ll be apt to more than
hear the whine of a bullet. They&rsquo;re bad men,
Sheriff Green told us, and if put in a hole, with a
chance of spending some years in prison, wouldn&rsquo;t
mind wounding a few of us&mdash;perhaps worse than
that, even.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad looked serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been considering that matter,&rdquo; he announced,
&ldquo;and trying to make up my mind just
what a party of Boy Scouts, caught in such a puzzle,
ought to do. If our real scoutmaster, Dr. Philander
Hobbs, was only here, that would be a question for
him to decide. I wish we had him along with us
right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the rest of us are mighty glad business
kept him tied down at home, just at the time we had
this great chance to come up into the Maine woods,&rdquo;
chuckled Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re as able to settle anything as well as Dr.
Philander,&rdquo; declared Allan. &ldquo;And so, please let us
know what came of your thinking this subject over;
because we all know you too well, Thad, to believe
you&rsquo;d ever drop it without hatching out some sort
of a scheme.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the ticket; we all want to know,&rdquo; echoed
Bumpus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>Of course this sort of talk must have been exceedingly
pleasant to the young patrol leader. He
would not have been a boy had he not been thrilled
by this showing of confidence which his chums
placed in his ability as a manager and scoutmaster;
and so he hastened to oblige the eager demands of
the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While we were tramping along homeward,&rdquo;
Thad continued, &ldquo;I got to figuring how best we
ought to act. You see, somehow that thing of
chasing after those toughs didn&rsquo;t appeal to me very
much, after hearing how a lump of lead can sound
when it&rsquo;s passing by so close to your head. And in
the end I had an idea. If you think it&rsquo;s worth anything,
why, we might try the same out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure we will!&rdquo; declared Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we know it&rsquo;s the right stuff, even before
you start in to explain,&rdquo; Step Hen volunteered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too sure of that,&rdquo; laughed Thad; &ldquo;but
here&rsquo;s the scheme, boys, and let&rsquo;s hear what you
think of it. Now, in the morning, sometime, we&rsquo;ll
just pack up, and start along with our paddles, as
if we meant to keep it going through the whole
blessed day. But that&rsquo;ll only be a big bluff, you understand;
because, when we&rsquo;ve got about a mile or
so above here, and the coast seems clear, why, we
can land, hide our stuff, perhaps leaving one to
guard the same, perhaps, and the rest put back to
the cabin here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wow! that&rsquo;s the thing!&rdquo; exclaimed Giraffe.
&ldquo;I get the idea, Thad. You expect we&rsquo;ll hide in
here, and gobble the gentlemen up as soon as they
come along; ain&rsquo;t that what you mean, now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite,&rdquo; said Thad. &ldquo;It might answer just
as well, in case when we got back here we could be
sure they hadn&rsquo;t arrived before us, and were already
quartered in the cabin. But if that proved to be the
case, why, we&rsquo;d set to work and try to surprise
Charlie Barnes and his pals. You see, whatever we
do, we want to keep in the background till we&rsquo;re
just ready to spring our trap; and in that way prevent
them from doing us any bodily harm. I&rsquo;m in
charge of the patrol, and I&rsquo;d feel pretty bad, now, if
on going home I had to show up with a bunch of
cripples on my hands. That&rsquo;s what keeps me guessing,
and trying to accomplish things without taking
too much risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good scheme, all right!&rdquo; commented Step
Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I say, too,&rdquo; added Bumpus.</p>
<p>Davy, Allan and Giraffe also declared that they
liked the plan immensely; and even Eli Crookes
grinned, Jim nodded his head in appreciation; while
Sebattis smoked on, and watched Thad admiringly
out of the corner of his black eye, as if he had never
before run across such a smart lad, and wondered
what it meant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But of course,&rdquo; Thad went on to say, &ldquo;the success
of such a plan depends altogether on one thing
to begin with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean whether they&rsquo;re bound to come to the
cabin here?&rdquo; asked Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; the scout leader went on, calmly.
&ldquo;I thought that all over carefully, and decided that,
judging from the actions of that man in looking in
here, as well as their hanging around the vicinity
when they had ought to be well on the way to the
Canadian border, that there must be some sort of
unusual attraction about this same old cabin for
those rascals!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, Thad; we&rsquo;re catching on to what you&rsquo;ve
got in mind,&rdquo; hinted Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We happen to know,&rdquo; said Thad; &ldquo;that this
chief hobo, who calls himself Charlie Barnes now,
though he may have gone by another name years
back, must have been a Maine guide once on a time.
If so, he is well acquainted up in this region, and
must know all about this abandoned cabin. Now, if
so be the third chap is sick, or badly hurt, as we&rsquo;ve
guessed, why, where could they find a better place
to stay for a while than right here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Seems like it,&rdquo; admitted Giraffe; &ldquo;and say,
p&rsquo;raps that&rsquo;s just why they cribbed your venison
like they did. If they expect to hole up here for
some weeks, lyin&rsquo; low while the sheriff and his posse
go chasin&rsquo; all over the country lookin&rsquo; for the runaways,
why, they&rsquo;d need a heap of grub; and so they
just couldn&rsquo;t resist the temptation to grab your little
buck. It&rsquo;d supply their wants for a long time, if
they only jerked the meat the way the Indians do,
and made it into pemmican.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to see you take that view of the matter.
Giraffe,&rdquo; Thad continued, for it was always an
object with him, as the leader of the patrol, to tempt
his scouts to think for themselves, and not depend
wholly on others to plan things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Thad,&rdquo; remarked Allan, about that time,&mdash;he
had been watching the face of the other for signs
that would tell him what Thad had on his mind;
&ldquo;was this the <i>only</i> thing you stirred up, that would
be apt to keep these fellows wanting to get in this
cabin so badly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, honest now, Allan,&rdquo; replied the other,
smilingly, &ldquo;it wasn&rsquo;t. I figured along another line
too. I said to myself, that supposing now, a year or
so ago this same hard case of a Charlie Barnes had
made another haul, and escaped to the woods with
his plunder, where would he be apt to hide that same
until the time when he could add to the pile, and
then skip across the border? And boys, I thought
that this deserted old cabin would offer him about
as snug a hiding-place for his loot as any place I
knew!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Thad, do you really think that?&rdquo; exclaimed
Bumpus, a smile appearing on his plump
face; &ldquo;just imagine us diggin&rsquo; up treasure, fellers,
would you; gold, and jewels, and all sorts of precious
things that these desperate yeggs have hooked
in their bold operations? And when we restored
the same to the original owners, how they&rsquo;d pour
the fat rewards into our pockets. Why, we&rsquo;d just
as like as not have our names in all the papers down
in New York, and be <i>fa</i>mous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; said Thad, &ldquo;you make me think of
the girl who was tripping to market with a basket of
eggs, and saying to herself, that after she&rsquo;d sold
those she&rsquo;d buy a pig; and when it grew up, she&rsquo;d
take that money and buy a calf; and then, after that
grew up to be a cow, with the money she&rsquo;d get from
selling all the milk she could lay a nice sum by, so
that when the right young man came along she&rsquo;d
have enough to get her outfit with, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she tripped once too often, fell over, and
every egg was broken,&rdquo; broke in Bumpus, with a
shout. &ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;ve heard my mother tell that story.
It means we hadn&rsquo;t ought to figure too far ahead.
But Thad. I want to say, I like your scheme; and
in the mornin&rsquo; we ought to turn this here old place
upside-down, huntin&rsquo; in every nook and cranny for
the hobo&rsquo;s plunder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not forgetting that loft up yonder, where our
friend, the bear&mdash;&rdquo; began Giraffe, and suddenly
broke off with a laugh, as he remembered that in the
other excitement he had forgotten all about his
private surprise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>He immediately went and picked up the bearskin,
and held it up before the admiring eyes of Thad and
Davy, who immediately started to ask innumerable
questions.</p>
<p>The story was by degrees told, and the late
comers allowed to taste the beautiful honey. Thad
declared he had noticed that Bumpus and Giraffe
looked a little swollen about the head, but other
things had kept him from asking the reason, up to
now.</p>
<p>The hour was growing pretty late, but strange to
say none of the scouts seemed to feel sleepy but
Bumpus, who nodded occasionally as he sat there,
trying to listen to the conversation that passed
among his mates.</p>
<p>Thad had meanwhile been using his eyes to some
advantage. He noticed that the stones about the
hearth were rather large, and to his mind one of
them had the appearance of having been recently
disturbed. Suddenly getting up, as the fire burned
low, and afforded him an opportunity to come near
without being scorched, Thad worked away for a
minute or so, trying to insert his fingers under this
certain hearth stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, try this for a lever, Thad,&rdquo; remarked
Allan, handing him a thick, short stick; for somehow
he had quickly guessed what the other had in
his mind, and was naturally intensely interested in
the result.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>So Thad, by inserting this under the stone, was
enabled to raise it up. Breathlessly the others
leaned forward to watch the result; for by now of
course even the aroused Bumpus had guessed what
Thad was doing.</p>
<p>The patrol leader seemed to be fumbling around
in some sort of little cavity he had found under the
hearth stone. Then, with an exclamation, he drew
some object into view, and laid it on the floor. It
seemed to be a bundle of old clothes; but when
Thad, with eager hands, had unrolled these, the
scouts held their very breath at the sight that met
their astonished eyes.</p>
<p>Thad had figured it all out, and now they understood
just why that leader of the yeggmen was so
determined to get into the old abandoned cabin in
the woods; he had hidden the proceeds of other robberies
there, and wished to take it all along with
him when he crossed over into a safe asylum in
Canada.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<h2 id="c21">CHAPTER XXI.
<br /><span class="small">THE DUMMY PACKET.</span></h2>
<p>Bumpus dug his knuckles into his eyes, and then
stared again at the pile of plunder which had evidently
been taken from some bank; for besides the
little rolls that seemed to contain gold eagles, and
half eagles, and fives, there were a number of packages
of bank bills, and a lot of bonds&mdash;at least that
was what the boys guessed they must be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody <i>please</i> give me a pinch,&rdquo; said Bumpus.
&ldquo;I sure must be dreaming one of my old
dreams about findin&rsquo; buried treasure. Hey! not so
hard, Step Hen; I&rsquo;m awake now all right, because
that hurt like the dickens. But just look at what
Thad&rsquo;s unearthed, would you? Whew! I don&rsquo;t
blame that feller for hangin&rsquo; around here. I&rsquo;d refuse
to be chased away too, if I had all that stuff
lyin&rsquo; under a stone in an old cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>For some little time the boys continued to talk.
Allan had wisely in the beginning stepped over and
hung something over the one little window of the
cabin. He seemed to understand that, with the finding
of this stolen plunder belonging to a bank that
had been looted at some previous day, they had
taken up issues with these desperate men; and
whether they wanted to or not, from this time forward
it must be a question as to whether the hobo
thieves recovered their prize; or were in turn taken
prisoner by the scouts, and the guides with them.</p>
<p>By unearthing this rich haul Thad had settled the
question. They could no longer hold aloof, and sit
on the fence; but must enter into the game with the
yeggmen.</p>
<p>And so the plan suggested, which looked to the
ultimate capture of the rascals, appealed to the boys
more than ever. If circumstances over which they
seemed to really have little control, forced them to
take a hand in the matter, it was the part of wisdom
that they get in the first blow; and not wait for the
desperate fugitives of the Maine woods to attack
them, in order to try and force them to hand over
this rich find.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d it do to make up a dummy bundle, with
these same old clothes,&rdquo; remarked Giraffe. &ldquo;We
could fasten it with the string, same as they had it;
and in case the fellers didn&rsquo;t take the trouble to
open the same, why, we&rsquo;d be that much ahead, you
see.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea, and can do no harm to try,&rdquo;
remarked the patrol leader, who was only too
pleased to receive suggestions from the scouts, even
though at times they thought of plans that were
wildly impracticable; for it showed their minds
were working; and anything was better than that
they fall into the state of letting some one else do
their thinking for them.</p>
<p>So Giraffe was set to work constructing the imitation
bundle. Of course it did not contain one
blessed thing worth mentioning. Bumpus wrote the
single suggestive word &ldquo;fooled&rdquo; on a piece of
paper, and wanted them to insert that; but Thad remarked
that it would be better not to further arouse
the anger of such lawless men. This was no child&rsquo;s
play in which they were now engaged, but the most
serious adventure of all they had ever run across;
and must be treated with the sober consideration
grown-up men would be apt to give to such a matter.</p>
<p>But even this rebuff could not quench the newly-aroused
spirit in the stout boy, Bumpus, who saw
his dreams coming true. He could imagine the
wonderful results when they delivered these valuable
bonds over to the bank that had been looted.
Surely there must have been a generous reward
offered for their return; which, with that they were
certain to receive for capturing the hobo thieves,
would cram the treasury of the Boy Scout troop,
and open up many delightful chances for other vacation
trips to far-away places.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what will we do with all this glorious
stuff?&rdquo; he asked, as they sat, and looked, and
talked, while the night wore on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to make it up into a packet, somehow,&rdquo;
remarked Thad. &ldquo;Then, when I&rsquo;ve got it in
as small a compass as possible, I&rsquo;ll wind a cord
around it every which way, and use a little piece of
red sealing wax I remember seeing in my haversack,
to seal it up with. Then nobody can break it open
without our knowing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My goodness! I hope now, Thad, you don&rsquo;t
think any scout would be so pokey as to want to
meddle with it, after you&rsquo;ve taken it in charge?&rdquo;
remarked Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied the patrol leader,
quickly; &ldquo;I know you all too well for that; but I
believe there&rsquo;s a certain amount of red tape to be
carried out in a case like this; and I&rsquo;m going to
fasten it in the presence of every one of you, so
that you can hold up your right hands and vow, if
ever you are asked, that everything we found is
sealed in this package. And here goes for a tough
job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Considering that he had little material to work
with, it was a hard task; but then, Thad possessed
considerable ingenuity; and could adapt himself to
circumstances wonderfully well. And the result was
all that could be asked, since the package he produced
was not very large, but quite compact, and
after being liberally daubed with the red sealing
wax, so that none of the cords could be undone,
really looked very important indeed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There, how will that do, boys?&rdquo; asked Thad,
when he had finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simply great!&rdquo; declared Giraffe; &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s a
wonder how you manage to get such big results
from small things. I never saw the like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking,&rdquo; mused Allan, &ldquo;that since
Charlie Barnes came here only last night, what is to
hinder him from paying us a visit again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so!&rdquo; ejaculated Giraffe. &ldquo;Say, mebbe
that&rsquo;s why Sebattis went out a long time back. He&rsquo;s
the sly one, now, let me tell you. Chances are he
expects that we may have uninvited company some
time around now; and if the Wandering Willy tries
to peep in at our window like he did last time, why,
he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to run up against Sebattis, good and
hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew that was why he went out,&rdquo; Thad observed,
&ldquo;and it gave me a comforting feeling; because
I&rsquo;m as sure as anything can be, that nobody
could steal up here on us with the Indian on
guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; added Step Hen. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got the
ears of a fox, and can hear the least sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of a weasel, you mean,&rdquo; Bumpus declared. &ldquo;I
never turn over in my sleep but what, if I raise my
head, there&rsquo;s them black eyes of Sebattis awatchin&rsquo;
me, just as if he expected I was goin&rsquo; to have a fit,
like Davy here used to take.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Forget that, won&rsquo;t you, Bumpus,&rdquo; said the
other hastily. &ldquo;I reckon I&rsquo;m cured of that caper
by now; but sometimes,&rdquo; he added, as he saw
Giraffe looking at him, and grinning, &ldquo;I do feel
signs like one was acomin&rsquo; on again, though it never
really and truly does, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, where will you put that, Thad?&rdquo; asked
Step Hen, pointing to the sealed package that had
been so officiously done up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! keep it out of sight under my blanket till
morning,&rdquo; answered the other. &ldquo;Then we can hide
it in one of the canoes, under the duffle, where it&rsquo;ll
be safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want you to take it in your boat, remember
that,&rdquo; observed Giraffe. &ldquo;You was the one to find
the prize, and the only claim any of the rest have to
the reward will be that we stood ready to defend it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad looked squarely at him as Giraffe said this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do for you, Giraffe,&rdquo; he remarked
sternly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hear any more like that.
There are six of us here, and two more at home.
Every scout will have an equal share in any reward
that may happen to come to us; yes, and more than
that, the other five who are on this expedition with
me are going to be credited with their portion of the
honor of recovering this lost bank capital. We&rsquo;re
in the same boat, sink or swim, survive or perish.
Understand that, fellows; and now after this, I&rsquo;ll
take it hard of you if any member of the Silver Fox
Patrol tries to shove more than a sixth of the glory
on my shoulders.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>They saw he meant it, and their boyish hearts
warmed within them at the knowledge that they had
such a splendid chum at the head of the patrol.
Where could another like Thad Brewster be found,
they would like to know?</p>
<p>The dummy package was placed carefully under
the hearthstone, and Thad tried the best he knew
how to arrange it just about as he had found the
treasure trove. And as one of them had said, if the
hoboes in their hurry failed to open it up, they might
remain in ignorance concerning their great loss, for
some length of time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I think that it must be nearly midnight,&rdquo;
announced Thad, &ldquo;and a lot of us are dead tired;
so I put it up to you, fellows, if we hadn&rsquo;t ought to
try and get some rest? We want to be in trim for
other work to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe held up his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Count me in,&rdquo; he remarked, wearily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ditto here,&rdquo; said Allan, also making the high
sign.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t crawl under my blanket any too soon to
please me,&rdquo; Davy added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if the rest of you want to turn in, I&rsquo;m
there,&rdquo; Step Hen declared, yawning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>All eyes were fastened on Bumpus, waiting to
hear his decision, so that it might be made unanimous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Scott! he&rsquo;s dead asleep, and sittin&rsquo; up at
that!&rdquo; exclaimed Giraffe.</p>
<p>Which was a fact; for the fat boy had been so
completely tired out with his labor of the morning,
when securing the store of honey; as well as from
the excitement and nervous shock brought on by the
bee stings, that he could not keep his eyes open any
longer; and sitting there like a heathen god, as
Giraffe called it, he had gone fast asleep.</p>
<p>Of course they had to wake poor Bumpus up, so
that he could take his shoes off, and get ready to
crawl under his blanket; but he started to perform
these little tasks grumblingly, because he had been
disturbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might let a feller snooze where he was,&rdquo; he
muttered, working away, with his eyes still closed.
&ldquo;I was just goin&rsquo; to sit down to the dinner table at
home, an&rsquo; it was Thanksgiving day too. Um! how
that big turkey did make me crazy to get at it. And
then comes a budge in the ribs, and Giraffe here
sayin&rsquo; as how I&rsquo;m takin&rsquo; all the room, an&rsquo; must roll
over. A feller never can be let alone when he
wants to, in this&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>Bumpus did not finish what he was saying. Nor
was he longer sitting there with his eyes closed,
groping at the fastening of his leggings in the endeavor
to get the shin protectors off. On the contrary
he started half-way to his feet, once more
wide-awake.</p>
<p>For without the slightest warning there came to
the ears of the scouts the loud report of a rifle from
some point just outside the cabin walls. And they
suddenly remembered what had been said only a
short time before, about the dangerous yeggmen
coming back again on this night.</p>
<p>And also that Sebattis was on guard.</p>
<h2 id="c22">CHAPTER XXII.
<br /><span class="small">THE NIGHT ALARM.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What did I do with my gun?&rdquo; cried Giraffe,
darting around this way and that, as he tried to remember
in which corner he had stacked his rifle,
after coming in earlier in the night, from the bear
hunt.</p>
<p>Already had Thad, Allan and Davy snatched up
their weapons, and made a bolt for the door, following
the lead of Jim and Eli, and wildly excited
by the possibilities of finding that something of a
tragic nature had been occurring without.</p>
<p>Poor Bumpus, having no gun of his own, looked
around in despair. He certainly did not want to be
left behind when all this turmoil was going on; nor
was he desirous of rushing out without some sort of
means of defending himself, in case he was set upon
by enemies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>So he hastened to snatch up the same stout stick
which had enabled Thad to pry loose the heavy
hearthstone. And swinging this vigorously, Bumpus
trotted after the other scouts, dragging his half-unfastened
leggings along with him as he went.</p>
<p>It was dark outside, for the young moon had
gone to rest long before. But then Thad, with his
customary wisdom, had remembered this, and as he
went out he snatched up the only lantern they had
brought along.</p>
<p>Bumpus could hear them all making for one
point, and he followed suit. Eli and Jim had been
able to locate the quarter from whence that single
shot had come, and were now heading for it.</p>
<p>At any rate, there had been no succeeding shots,
no bombardment of the cabin. And Thad, thinking
it wise to have some light on the subject, stopped for
a few seconds to scratch a match, and apply the
flame to the wick of the lantern, after which he
again hastened on.</p>
<p>By that time the others had gone ahead, but his
short delay served one good turn, since it enabled
poor puffing Bumpus to reach the side of the patrol
leader, which fact, no doubt, gave the fat boy considerable
gratification.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Thad?&rdquo; Bumpus managed to gasp,
as they hurried along.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know myself,&rdquo; came the reply; &ldquo;but
we&rsquo;ll soon find out now, because I hear them talking
just ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s Sebattis, too,&rdquo; declared Bumpus, in
a relieved tone; just as though he may have been
worrying over the possibility of the Indian having
been injured when that gun was discharged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it is,&rdquo; Thad said. &ldquo;And I never
thought it was any one else but him who fired that
shot. He must have believed he saw a suspicious
figure making up through the brush, or trying to
damage our boats; though why these men should
want to do that, when they&rsquo;re hoping for us to clear
out, surprises me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were now close on the rest of the party; indeed,
by the light which the lantern gave, they could
make the group out, all of the others being clustered
around the Indian guide, who was talking in his
usual short-sentence way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear sound, see something move, shoot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That comprised the whole business with Sebattis.
Where a white man would have described how he
was thrilled to locate the suspicious noise; and tell
what his feelings were as he drew up his gun and
blazed away; the Penobscot Indian simply gave the
bare facts&mdash;he came, he heard, he fired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think, now, it could have been one of
those wolves we heard yelping last night, do you,
Sebattis?&rdquo; Giraffe ventured to ask, more to draw
the other out than because he himself believed any
such thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! when wolf speak does he swear hard?&rdquo;
asked Sebattis, quaintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! then he <i>must</i> have been a man, because so
far animals haven&rsquo;t learned how to use hard language,&rdquo;
admitted Giraffe, doubtless chuckling at the
success that had followed his little plan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have been pretty mad because you
blocked his plans, to use hard words like that,&rdquo; ventured
Davy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurt!&rdquo; declared the guide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He means that he thinks he wounded the fellow,&rdquo;
explained Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what else could he expect, to come nosing
around our camp like that, and even taking a sly
shot at our hunters, after stealing their nice buck?&rdquo;
demanded Bumpus, who could not be accused of
acting as though he were sleepy now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where were they when you heard them first,
Sebattis?&rdquo; asked Thad, wishing to get all the information
possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Round here, mebbe. Hear talk in whisper like,
and know two men come. Then fire just one shot.
That all. They make off in hurry, quick!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see if we can find their tracks,&rdquo; suggested
Step Hen; but before he spoke Thad was already
circling around, holding the lantern close to the
ground, and carefully looking to see if there could
be found any signs telling that the Indian had not
made a mistake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope they won&rsquo;t think to take a pot shot at the
lot of us while we stand around here,&rdquo; said Giraffe,
uneasily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; spoke up Bumpus: &ldquo;a
sharpshooter couldn&rsquo;t hit you, because you ain&rsquo;t
wide enough to make a shadow. Think of me, and
what dreadful chances I&rsquo;m taking all the time. They
could get me by shootin&rsquo; with their eyes shut. But
all the same, you don&rsquo;t hear me whine. I&rsquo;m ready
to take my medicine without showing the white
feather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that over there; looks like a man kneeling
down, and aimin&rsquo; a gun!&rdquo; called out Step Hen
just then; and forgetting the boast that was still on
his lips, Bumpus threw himself on the ground, and
started to crawl behind a clump of thick bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a stump, after all,&rdquo; announced Thad,
throwing the light of his lantern in the direction of
the suspicious object.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up, Bumpus, the coast is clear,&rdquo; said Giraffe,
sneeringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These old leggings keep gettin&rsquo; under my feet
the worst kind,&rdquo; remarked Bumpus, complacently,
as though a poor excuse might be better than none.
&ldquo;But see there, the Indian&rsquo;s found something or
other. Just as like as not it&rsquo;s them tracks we&rsquo;re all
lookin&rsquo; for.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just what it is,&rdquo; added Davy Jones, eagerly.</p>
<p>As scouts who yearned to learn the many interesting
things connected with woodcraft, it can be
set down as certain that Step Hen and his comrades
gathered about Sebattis and Thad, then and there,
convinced that something was coming worth while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as Sebattis told us, there were two of
them,&rdquo; Thad was saying, while he bent down to see
the imprint of footgear at closer range.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to be something familiar about one of
them tracks, Thad,&rdquo; remarked Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, our old friend, the patched shoe, has
turned up again,&rdquo; chuckled the patrol leader, pointing
to the plain, unmistakable sign across the toe of
the impression of the shoe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which of course means that Charlie is doing it
again,&rdquo; Step Hen remarked. &ldquo;He wants to be in
every mix-up, seems like. But if here are two,
where is the other feller?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know we decided that he must be sick or
something like that,&rdquo; Allan pursued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were coming straight at the cabin when
our guard turned them around, and sent &rsquo;em flyin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
Giraffe put in. &ldquo;That looks like they wanted to
see if we&rsquo;d disturbed that stuff any. I guess they&rsquo;re
gettin&rsquo; rather nervous about our hangin&rsquo; out here
so long. It sorter interferes with their plans,
p&rsquo;raps.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Allan observed, drily, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll see us
getting out of here to-morrow, if they keep their
eyes open, which we hope will be the case. And
then perhaps this Charlie Barnes and his two cronies
will think they&rsquo;re safe in entering the old cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And putting up at the woods&rsquo; tavern for a time,
feedin&rsquo; off our nice venison, to beat the band,&rdquo;
grumbled Giraffe, who never could forgive the hobo
outfit for depriving the scouts of that young buck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder, now,&rdquo; piped up Bumpus, &ldquo;if the
chief means to start in tracking these two men tonight?
He&rsquo;s thrown a good scare into &rsquo;em, seems;
and they&rsquo;re running yet, I just reckon; but he gave
&rsquo;em back the shot they fired at Thad and Eli and
Davy here. That&rsquo;s the way we pay back our debts.
All good scouts are supposed to settle when they
owe anything, ain&rsquo;t they? What&rsquo;s Thad doing now,
I wonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you take us for, Bumpus?&rdquo; demanded
Giraffe. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand that Thad said he
wanted us to do things with as little risk as we
could? And then, to think we&rsquo;d try to foller up
these hard cases, holdin&rsquo; a lantern, just to ask &rsquo;em
to bang away at us as much as they pleased. We
ain&rsquo;t that green. The other plan promises to work
best, and you see if Thad don&rsquo;t stick by it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the fat boy plaintively, &ldquo;How was
I to know what they&rsquo;d expect to be doin&rsquo;? And
when you&rsquo;re puzzled what to think, ain&rsquo;t it policy to
just hold off, and fight for wind? That&rsquo;s what I
was adoin&rsquo; when I said that. But Thad is lookin&rsquo;
for something again, because he&rsquo;s movin&rsquo; off with
the lantern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not wishing to be left in the dark, all the others
followed Thad and Sebattis, both of whom seemed
to be searching industriously along the ground, as
if they had lost something which was worth looking
for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;P&rsquo;raps they got a notion one of them fellers
might a dropped somethin&rsquo;,&rdquo; suggested Step Hen,
himself unable to grasp the true meaning of the
strange actions of the two ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re closer to it than you think,&rdquo; was the
puzzling remark of Allan; while old Eli and young
Jim seemed too amused by the remark.</p>
<p>And while they all watched, and speculated, each
according to his light, they saw Sebattis come to a
pause. He called to Thad, whose back happened to
be turned at the moment; and the patrol leader
hastened to join him.</p>
<p>Sebattis was pointing down at his feet. The boys
noticed that there was something rather dramatic
about his attitude while doing this; and Giraffe
voiced the feelings of his mates when he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He found what he was looking for, believe me;
and what d&rsquo;ye suppose it c&rsquo;n be?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>The scouts pushed forward. Just as Thad was
doing, so Allan, Step Hen, Davy, Giraffe, yes, and
even Bumpus, as curious as the rest, craned their
necks forward, and stared at the object in plain
view beyond the tip of the dark finger which Sebattis
had extended.</p>
<p>There was a plain imprint of a shoe there, though
not the one that bore the mark across the sole. And
there was something more than this; for when Thad
touched what seemed to be a little dark pebble,
with the point of a stick he had picked up, they
realized what it was.</p>
<p>A drop of blood, showing that Sebattis had made
no mistake when he declared his random shot had
at least slightly wounded one of the prowling
hoboes!</p>
<h2 id="c23">CHAPTER XXIII.
<br /><span class="small">A FLANK MOVEMENT.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I should say Sebattis <i>did</i> hit something!&rdquo; declared
Giraffe, staring hard at the tell-tale spot in
the footprint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it wasn&rsquo;t Charlie that got hurt,&rdquo; remarked
Davy, evidently alive to the fact that the track which
showed the trace of blood did not have any cross
line, showing where the sole had been patched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it was the other fellow,&rdquo; observed Thad.
&ldquo;Where was he hit, Sebattis?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Left leg, not much, but bleed heap,&rdquo; and the
Indian pointed to several other significant spots as
he moved along the trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now how under the sun could he tell it was the
left leg?&rdquo; asked Step Hen, evidently deeply puzzled
to account for the positive manner in which the
guide made this assertion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! that would be easy enough,&rdquo; remarked the
patrol leader. &ldquo;Just stop, and you&rsquo;ll remember that
each foot makes a different track. This one is the
left foot. And now you&rsquo;ll be quick to think, even
if you don&rsquo;t say it, that perhaps that drop could
have fallen from the right foot as it was raised, into
the track of the left foot. Sebattis has other ways
to prove what he says. Show them, chief, won&rsquo;t
you; because they want to learn all they can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! look this way, see how,&rdquo; replied the dark-faced
guide, leading the several eager scouts to
where he knew an extra-plain print of the foot in
question might be found.</p>
<p>Then he pointed out the difference between the
mark of the right from the left foot, and showed
them that there was a heavier trail where that same
right shoe happened to be planted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You understand?&rdquo; remarked Thad, who was
following all this with considerable interest himself,
for he, too, had more or less to learn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me he means that if a feller happened
to get hurt, sudden like, in his left leg, he&rsquo;d begin to
limp,&rdquo; Giraffe spoke up, eagerly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And when he limped,&rdquo; Step Hen went on to
add, &ldquo;it stands to reason the print of the foot on
the leg he wanted to favor wouldn&rsquo;t be near so plain
as the other. Why ain&rsquo;t that the easiest thing you
ever heard tell of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure it is,&rdquo; Davy Jones insinuated; &ldquo;and after
Columbus showed those Spanish grandees how to
stand an egg up on end by punching the top down on
the table, why, didn&rsquo;t they think that was the silliest
thing ever? Oh! it&rsquo;s just as simple as turnin&rsquo; over
your hand&mdash;after another feller has been and told
you how.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same, it is easy,&rdquo; Thad went on to say,
&ldquo;and next time, perhaps some of you will be able to
figure things out yourselves. That&rsquo;s what scouts
ought to do every time. That&rsquo;s the best part of the
Boy Scout movement, General Baden-Powell says;
it makes boys stop depending on other people, when
they can just as well look out for themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will these hoboes haul off now, do you expect,
Thad, and give the cabin a wide berth?&rdquo; asked
Bumpus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it begins to look as though they ought to
steer clear of it, as long as we&rsquo;re in possession,&rdquo; the
patrol leader replied. &ldquo;Still, you can never tell.
By now they must be feeling pretty ugly toward us;
and when such men have a grudge pushing them on,
it&rsquo;s hard to say what they wouldn&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ketch me agoin&rsquo; to sleep then,&rdquo; remarked Bumpus;
but even while he was making this brave remark,
with one of his hands he was trying to suppress
a great yawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I don&rsquo;t suppose there will be as much
danger as that,&rdquo; Thad continued, not wishing to
alarm his chums unnecessarily. &ldquo;The guides will
divide up the balance of the night into three
watches; and if we like, one of us can keep company;
in fact,&rdquo; he went on in haste, fearing that
Bumpus might, in the goodness of his heart, volunteer
his services, which it would be hard to decline,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll appoint Allan here as one of the assistants, to
help out Jim; while Giraffe can stay up with Eli;
and I&rsquo;ll share the watch of Sebattis, because I want
to have a little whispered talk with him as we sit
alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it was arranged. Bumpus made out to feel a
little hurt that he had been overlooked in the distribution;
but Davy showed him that both he and
Step Hen were in the same boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; he added as a clincher, &ldquo;you know
you haven&rsquo;t got any gun, Bumpus; and don&rsquo;t know
much about firearms anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you forget it,&rdquo; remarked the stout scout
earnestly; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just determined to know more
about &rsquo;em right along, after this. The Boy Scouts
may stand for peace, all right; but I c&rsquo;n see right
now that the feller that&rsquo;s able to look out for himself
is just the one that never gets trampled on. Be prepared
to defend yourself, and chances are you&rsquo;ll
never be called on to do a blessed thing. Oh! I&rsquo;m
on to a few dodges. I ain&rsquo;t so much asleep as some
of you think. Wait till we go off on our trip across
the Continent, with the money we&rsquo;re going to rake
in for recovering this stuff, an&rsquo; capturin&rsquo; the thieves;
mebbe I&rsquo;ll show you a thing or two then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got a programme all laid out, I do believe,&rdquo;
ventured Step Hen, afterward to Giraffe; &ldquo;and expects
to take lessons in shooting, and all sorts of
stunts, once we get back to Cranford. But it&rsquo;ll be
the making of Bumpus if he does wake up and do all
kinds of things. He&rsquo;ll quit bein&rsquo; so fat then, and
make muscle instead. And for one, I hope he carries
it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The entire party went back to the cabin. Here
arrangements for the balance of the night were concluded,
and the first pair sent out to take their places
as sentries.</p>
<p>Bumpus had declared that he would not sleep a
wink; but once he lay down, he really knew nothing
more until he felt some one tugging at his sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it my turn to be on guard? All right, I&rsquo;ll be
up right away!&rdquo; he exclaimed, and then began to
sniff the air. &ldquo;Say, what&rsquo;s all this mean; are you
goin&rsquo; to eat breakfast in the middle of the night?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Go over to the door, and look out,&rdquo; laughed
Thad. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll think it still funnier to see the silly
old sun poking his face up at such a time; but he&rsquo;s
gone and done it, all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blessed if I ain&rsquo;t slept the whole night,&rdquo; muttered
Bumpus, not knowing whether to be pleased
because he had obtained such a refreshing sleep,
or miffed on account of having been neglected when
there was &ldquo;a call for all brave men and true.&rdquo;
Finally he concluded that what was done could not
be undone; and besides, that venison did smell
mighty appetizing. So he folded up his blanket, and
went outdoors to chase the last remnant of drowsiness
from his eyes by a dash of icy water.</p>
<p>There was no haste, for they did not mean to
leave their present comfortable quarters until about
the middle of the morning. This had been decided
on as the best policy to be pursued; since they hoped
that their actions would be observed by those in
whom they were so deeply interested.</p>
<p>By degrees they started to pack their belongings,
and stow them away in their regular places; for
each canoe had its own complement, the object
being to divide the many things besides tents which
they carried, so that the boats might be about
equally loaded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>It is no easy task to paddle a heavily charged
canoe up against a strong current, hour after hour.
Muscles hardened by constant use are needed to accomplish
such a feat successfully without great
fatigue. The scouts knew this now, if they had not
been so wise before; for at sundry times each of
them had been given opportunities to wield the
spruce paddle, and battle with the swift current.</p>
<p>It was in the neighborhood of ten o&rsquo;clock that
the last thing was stowed; and after looking all
around to make sure that nothing had been forgotten,
the patrol leader gave the signal to depart.</p>
<p>Bumpus did not have his bugle along on this expedition.
He had wanted to carry it, being a clever
musician, and quite fond of practicing the many fine
calls whereby scouts may regulate their going to bed,
rising in the morning, assembling for meals, and
other things. But Thad and Allan had shown him
the folly of sounding a bugle in the Maine woods,
where, as hunters, they were expected to keep as still
as possible, so that the big game they hoped to secure
might not take the alarm, and flee wildly from
the vicinity of such weird sounds.</p>
<p>But Bumpus, not to be entirely undone, placed his
hand to his mouth, and managed to give a pretty
good imitation of the bugle call; though he subsided
suddenly when he saw the patrol leader frowning at
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>So they left the spot where so many interesting, as
well as exciting, events had come to visit them.
And they carried away quite a few things besides the
memories that would always haunt them. There
was the honey, for instance, fastened up in every
possible receptacle that could hold it securely; then
they had some bear meat that would do to chop up
into hash; the fine skin that Giraffe meant to have
made into a rug for the floor of his den at home;
and last but far from least, that precious packet so
carefully tied up and sealed, containing the plunder
which some bank must have lost a year or more
back.</p>
<p>This, of course, had been carefully hidden, so that
even though the hoboes were secretly watching their
departure, they could hardly guess that the scouts
were carrying off their ill-gotten loot.</p>
<p>Gaily they paddled against the current. Although
they were warned not to seem to stare around in
too curious a fashion, most of the boys were really
watching the shore as they bucked up against the
stream. And a short time after they had quite lost
sight of the cabin and landing, Giraffe quietly informed
Thad, who was close by, that he was pretty
positive he had seen a man peering out at them from
a clump of bushes along the river bank. He had not
mentioned the fact at the time, because he said he
was afraid one of the &ldquo;tenderfeet,&rdquo; meaning possibly
Bumpus and Step Hen, might betray themselves
by appearing too curious, and thus bring a
shot from the shore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>On they pushed until fully a mile had been
covered. Thad allowed the boys to emit an occasional
shout, meaning that it should be carried
back to the ears of the man on the shore, and by
gradually growing fainter and fainter, convince him
that the party had really gone for good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the very place where we want to land,&rdquo;
said Thad, after a little more time had elapsed.
&ldquo;Plenty of rushes growing along the bank, where
we can hide the canoes, and leave two to guard them,
which will be Jim, and Bumpus here. The rest of
us ought to be enough to do the business, if we
manage to surprise the hobo crowd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing what his fate was to be Bumpus groaned;
but remembering what a scout must promise to do
when given an order by one in authority, he shut his
teeth hard, and doubtless determined that the next
time he would have a gun, and then they must consider
that he had rights, as well as the remainder
of the party.</p>
<p>Once in the rushes the landing was made. It
proved to be a splendid place for slipping away without
showing themselves, for the woods grew unusually
thick just alongside, and the sun happened
to be hidden by clouds at the time, which was near
noon.</p>
<p>And this was the way Thad led his company back
toward the lone cabin, with himself and Sebattis in
the lead, then Davy and Giraffe; and old Eli, in conjunction
with Step Hen and Allan, bringing up the
rear,&mdash;seven in all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<h2 id="c24">CHAPTER XXIV.
<br /><span class="small">WHAT WOODCRAFT DOES.</span></h2>
<p>After leaving the spot where they had drawn the
three canoes into the rushes, the little party started
through the woods. Bumpus was very much grieved
to see the balance of the scouts go off without him.
He did not say anything; but his rosy fat face was
eloquent enough, as he nodded in turn to each one
of his chums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor old Bumpus,&rdquo; said Giraffe, to Davy, in a
whisper, &ldquo;he feels badly cut up at not gettin&rsquo; a
chance to earn that reward he&rsquo;s had on his mind so
long. And you mark me, the first opening Bumpus
gets, he&rsquo;ll be buying a gun, all right. He doesn&rsquo;t
like to be left out of the fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a rule they were supposed to keep absolute
silence, and Giraffe knew this, as did Davy. Hence
the other only nodded in reply, and taking his cue
from this, the long-legged scout relapsed into quiet
again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>But Giraffe was wide-awake. He meant to observe
every little thing that took place around him.
With two such veteran guides as old Eli, and the
Indian, doubtless there would be more or less woodcraft
displayed that must be well worth treasuring
up; because a Boy Scout cannot learn too much
along these lines.</p>
<p>And the first thing Giraffe noticed was the confident
way in which the leader started out. Why,
he never seemed to bother his head in the least as to
what direction the cabin lay in. Giraffe marveled
at this very much. He realized that if the task had
been left to him, he would have had to cudgel his
poor brains to remember all he had been told by
Allan, as to the various methods whereby woodsmen
know what is north, when in the dense forest, with
the sun hidden from sight, and no compass along.</p>
<p>So Giraffe amused himself while he strode along
as carefully as he knew how. He attempted to
picture himself in the r&ocirc;le of guide to just such an
expedition, starting out to get to the cabin as quickly
as possible, by taking a short cut through the woods,
rather than by following the windings of the river.</p>
<p>What would he do first? Oh! yes, there was the
bark of the tree to be observed, and the fine green
moss that grew only on one side, never all the way
around. He remembered that this moss was said to
be almost universally upon the north side of the
tree, and that if it varied at all, it leaned toward the
northwest; because it was from that quarter most
of the severe wintry gales came.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>But trees differ; and to his surprise Giraffe failed
to find this moss in the quantities he had expected.
Evidently then pine trees are in a class by themselves,
he concluded.</p>
<p>But there were other ways of finding this out.
How about the general slant of the trees? Didn&rsquo;t
his instructor assure him that it only needed one
glance around, for an old traveler through the
forests to tell where north was? He would notice
the slant of the trees, and if there were any lying on
the ground, observe the way they had fallen, when
overturned by the fierce wind. Why, that ought to
be the easiest thing in the world; and Giraffe was
beginning to feel quite proud of the knowledge he
possessed when suddenly a very disquieting thought
flashed through his head.</p>
<p>He knew which was north, east, west and south
all right; but how was that to tell him where the old
cabin lay? He might guess that in all probability it
was somewhere off to the southeast; but that was a
pretty big region, and the chances of his finding it
might be set down as ten against one.</p>
<p>Evidently, then, something else was needed besides
the ability to tell where the north lay. In fact,
Giraffe was beginning to realize that a good scout
must keep a mental map of the country in his head.
He may not need a compass one-half so much as he
has a use for constant wakefulness, and the power
of observation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>He should be able under such conditions as these
to put a finger on a certain point of the rude chart
he draws, and say: &ldquo;here&rsquo;s where I am right now,
and there lies the cabin, exactly sou-south east of
me; and I can tell where that quarter is as easy as
falling off a log.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The more Giraffe got to thinking about this subject
the more he felt enthusiastic over it. Why, he
had really never understood how intensely interesting
it was. And then and there the boy determined
that he would find out all about it. Allan knew,
and Allan was only too willing to instruct his fellow
scouts in the arts pertaining to woodcraft.</p>
<p>Practical demonstration is worth many times over
what a fellow might learn from books. Take that
Indian picture writing, for instance; a boy might
read about it, and think it rather interesting; but
when taking part in the game himself, puzzling his
head over the meaning of the plain pictures of men,
animals, camp-fire smoke, canoes, tracks in the dirt,
and all such things, he would discover that is was
intensely exciting, and liable to beat any game of
fox and geese he had ever indulged in.</p>
<p>All this while they were making fair progress on
their way.</p>
<p>Sebattis never seemed to swerve once, except to
avoid some obstacle. Why, he was evidently as
positive about his course as Giraffe might be when
walking along a street in Cranford. And doubtless,
the trails of the great pine woods were just as
familiar to this dusky son of the wilderness as those
streets could be to one who had been born and
brought up among them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>Giraffe figured that they must be about half-way
to the cabin by now, though of course it had to be
mere guess work on his part, since he had no means
of knowing the facts.</p>
<p>He did notice that Sebattis was growing a little
more cautious. And also that Thad, looking around
just then as if to see how the others were coming
along, and catching the eye of Step Hen, put his
finger on his lips, as if in that way he would warn
the greenhorn scouts to exercise additional care.</p>
<p>It was certainly getting mighty exciting. Giraffe
felt hot and cold by turns; but he would not allow
himself for one moment to believe that this sensation
had anything to do with the quality called
fear.</p>
<p>He gritted his teeth, and put on a severe look.
He would show them, if the case came to a point
where there must ensue a rough and tumble fight,
that because he had subscribed to the peace-loving
rules of the scouts, he could at the same time rise
to a special occasion, when valor was needed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>Why, this feeling was something the same as that
which had attacked him when about to fire his first
shot at the big black bear. Allan had described it
to him once, when telling him how he must overcome
the &ldquo;buck ague&rdquo; upon getting his first
chance to shoot a deer. And Giraffe was determined
to conquer himself now, so that he might not
later on feel a tinge of shame when speaking of the
way they returned to the cabin, bent on capturing
the lawless hoboes.</p>
<p>Why, there was Sebattis bending low now, and
advancing with redoubled caution. They must
surely be close upon the cabin; perhaps it was even
in sight, if one cared to raise his head above the
tops of the bushes that together with brushwood
and dead treetops lay in the way.</p>
<p>No one could equal Giraffe in such a maneuver as
this. Nature had given him the advantage over his
fellows when endowing him with that extra long
neck. And doubtless the shorter Davy, with his
thick neck, envied Giraffe, when he saw how easily
the other surmounted difficulties in the way of taking
an observation, which were bound to prove a
barrier to him.</p>
<p>Sure enough. Giraffe caught a fugitive glimpse
of something that looked like the back wall of the
old cabin, for he saw neither door nor window.
How wonderful that the sagacious Penobscot brave
could have taken them directly there; and so far
as he, Giraffe, had noticed, without once feeling of
the bark of the trees, or even sweeping one glance
toward the heavens.</p>
<p>Now that the Indian and Thad had dropped on
their knees. Of course the others were expected to
do the same, and quickly did they follow suit. It
<span class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
must be a part of the game; indeed, Giraffe would
have been sorely disappointed had they failed to go
through this same experience. In all the books he
had read of forest trailing, and advancing upon an
enemy&rsquo;s camp, it was absolutely necessary to go the
last part of the journey on hands and knees. And
besides, it added vastly to the interest of the thing,
Giraffe thought.</p>
<p>So they crept along, getting gradually nearer
and nearer to the cabin. So far as could be seen,
all was quiet around that place, just as they had left
it, in fact. If the hoboes had already arrived they
certainly gave no sign of their presence.</p>
<p>Perhaps Sebattis, with his wonderfully trained
ear, was able to catch slight sounds that would not
reach some of the rest of them, bunglers at best in
the science of woodcraft. He seemed to be advancing
with perfect confidence; and yet at the same
time Giraffe could not but notice that the dusky-skinned
Maine guide always kept his gun in a position
for instant use.</p>
<p>It made Giraffe remember what he had once read
about the early Virginia and New England settlers,
pious men, all of them, to be sure; but realizing
that each was expected to do his part in taking
care of home and family. Giraffe had often repeated
the words of their motto to himself, and figured
out just what it meant to say &ldquo;trust in the
Lord; but keep your powder dry.&rdquo; Sebattis felt
perfect confidence in his ability to reach the wall of
the cabin unobserved; but at the same time he was
always ready for <i>accidents</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>But they were now about the end of the little
creeping journey, for the grim back wall of the
trapper&rsquo;s old weather-beaten cabin was at hand.
One by one the crawlers arrived, and ranged themselves
as close as they could, following the example
of the two who had reached the goal first.</p>
<p>Giraffe was immediately conscious of some sort
of movement within. It was as if a party might be
laboring at something that rather tried his muscle;
for besides the heavy breathing, there came a rustling
noise, and then mutterings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gimme that piece of wood over there, Kimball,&rdquo;
a voice suddenly growled. &ldquo;This stone sure beats
my time, the way she sticks. I never thort she was
half as heavy. Throw it acrost to me, if you don&rsquo;t
want to git up. Thet&rsquo;s the ticket. Now, will you
be good, consarn you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It gave Giraffe a thrill. He seemed to guess that
the speaker must be working at the hearthstone,
under which the scouts had found all that wonderful
plunder. What would happen when he discovered
how the package left there was only a false
&ldquo;dummy,&rdquo; and that the bank loot had been carried
off? Before Giraffe could settle this at all in his
mind, he heard the man inside give a little shout.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Kimball, I tell you! The stuff is
here, under the stone, and jest like we left it a year
ago. They never once suspected, the innocents,
jest how near they was to a fortune. Things is
atakin&rsquo; another turn, and I reckon our hard luck&rsquo;s
skipped out. This knocks a big load off my shoulders,
believe me, Kimball!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c25">CHAPTER XXV.
<br /><span class="small">SURPRISING CHARLIE.</span></h2>
<p>Sebattis was quietly creeping, foot by foot,
along the wall of the cabin. Giraffe realized that it
was the intention of the guide to make his way
along the side, so as to command the front, where
the only exit could be found. This they must cover,
if they expected to hold the situation.</p>
<p>Old Eli had pushed up alongside the Indian.
He seemed to feel that if it came to a case of holding
the hoboes up, the desperate rascals would be
more apt to surrender if they saw two determined
men in the front rank of those who covered them
with their guns, than if they believed the whole
posse to be made up of inexperienced half-grown
Boy Scouts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>Of course this started the others moving also,
since no one felt like being left behind. Being close
to the wall, it was possible for them to hear what
was being said within; for the two men did not
speak in anything bordering on whispers. They
did not dream of the danger that was hovering over
their heads; and the finding of the bundle, apparently
undisturbed, seemed to make them both
happier than they could have been for some time.</p>
<p>When they reached the corner of the cabin the
creepers turned it. Now they had to remember
that the little window was here, and that if one of
the new inmates of the hut chanced to thrust his
face close up to the wonderful sash that had survived
all these years of cold and heat, there was danger
that they would be discovered, should one of
them stray from the wall.</p>
<p>Giraffe was listening to what the men were saying.
Somehow there seemed to be a sort of strange
fascination about playing the part of eavesdropper
in a case like this. But he did not allow himself to
get so deeply interested as to forget all idea of
caution.</p>
<p>The man with the great, heavy voice he guessed
must be the leader, who went by the name of Charlie
Barnes. He it had been, Thad and Allan had declared,
who led the flight of the hoboes through the
great Maine woods. And it had been this fact that
seemed to convince the scoutmaster Charlie must
at one time have been playing the r&ocirc;le of guide in
these same woods.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>Apparently he had not bothered undoing the
bundle then, for there was no trace of anger or
bitter disappointment in his tones, such as must
have been the case had he learned of the cheat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s the leg, Kimball?&rdquo; he was asking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurts pretty bad, let me tell you,&rdquo; came the reply;
&ldquo;and the worst of it is, I can&rsquo;t get the bleed
to stop. If this keeps on, I&rsquo;ll keel over soon; I&rsquo;m
feeling that weak, Charlie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man with the bass voice said something that
sounded like strong language. At first Giraffe
feared he had taken a notion to open up the package,
and learned of the cheat; but when he spoke, this
proved not to be the case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s hard luck, ain&rsquo;t it, Kimball?&rdquo; he went
on. &ldquo;The only feller in our bunch thet knows a
blamed thing about the doctor game, he&rsquo;s gone an&rsquo;
took sick hisself, an&rsquo; is alyin&rsquo; thar under thet ledge,
whar we&rsquo;ve hed to camp out ever since larnin&rsquo;
thet them hunters was occupyin&rsquo; this here cabin.
But after I&rsquo;m rested a bit, tell you what I&rsquo;ll do&mdash;you
lay around and take it easy, while I hike back
and bring my brother-in-law here. He&rsquo;s on&rsquo;y a light
weight, an&rsquo; I guess as how I kin kerry him on my
back. Won&rsquo;t be the fust heavy pack I&rsquo;ve toted over
the Maine carries, believe me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Charlie,&rdquo; said the other, who possessed
a high voice, exactly the opposite of that belonging
to the big leader. &ldquo;And p&rsquo;raps, now, Dick
might be in one of his lucid turns, so he could tell
me what to do to stop this pesky bleed. I never
knowed what a crazy job it was till now, not to
understand the first thing &rsquo;bout stoppin&rsquo; blood from
flowin&rsquo; from a wound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sho! thet&rsquo;s nawthin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;ve seen a logger bleed
right to death &rsquo;cause nobody had any ijee how to do
that same. You&rsquo;d think loggers, of all men&rsquo;d larn
sech tricks. Likewise, you&rsquo;d expect sailors would
every one of &rsquo;em know how to swim; but they don&rsquo;t,
in half the cases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Charlie, what we goin&rsquo; to do?&rdquo; asked the
wounded man, fretfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye mean by askin&rsquo; thet, Kimball?&rdquo; demanded
the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supposin&rsquo; I get in trim to move in a day or two,
how long must we hang out in these here diggings,
to take care of Dick?&rdquo; Kimball asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wall, I want to do the right thing by the pore
critter,&rdquo; replied Charlie, reflectively. &ldquo;You remembers
that he&rsquo;s my wife&rsquo;s brother. But in course
thar&rsquo;s got to be a limit. We&rsquo;re in danger every
minit we stays here this side the border. An&rsquo; with
thet thar sheriff pokin&rsquo; &rsquo;raound every which way,
tryin&rsquo; to locate us, it&rsquo;d be crazy fur us to hang out
here long.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Put a limit on the time, Charlie. He ain&rsquo;t any
relation of mine, you see, and I just don&rsquo;t feel like
taking chances on twenty years to oblige your wife&rsquo;s
brother. P&rsquo;raps I couldn&rsquo;t make it just as well
without you, but I know which is north, an&rsquo; that
safety lies that way; so I&rsquo;d just keep on travelin&rsquo;
till I learned I was over the line in Canada.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you what, Kimball,&rdquo; said the other, after
a pause, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll give the poor feller till to-morry
night. If he ain&rsquo;t better then, we jest got to leave
hyar by the next mornin&rsquo; sure. The best we kin
do is to fix him comfortable like, with a plenty o&rsquo;
water and grub handy, and let him take chances.
Now, as I hev got my hands on this hyar bundle o&rsquo;
stuff again, I jest don&rsquo;t feel like bein&rsquo; caged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Charlie,&rdquo; replied the other.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to desert a man any more than you
do; but what&rsquo;s a fellow goin&rsquo; to do? We&rsquo;d all get
caught if we hung out here too long. As it is, we
can send the sheriff word when we&rsquo;re safe over the
line, and he&rsquo;ll find Dick. They ain&rsquo;t got much on
the boy, you know; and if he&rsquo;s sent up at all, it&rsquo;d
only be for a few years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time Giraffe himself was crawling past
under the little window. He knew that he must be
making more or less of a rustling sound while
moving along; to his ears all trifling things were
magnified immensely; why, he could even hear the
pounding of his rapidly beating heart, and wondered
if it was calculated to catch the attention of
those within the cabin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>However, he realized that several things were
acting in his favor. In the first place the wind
made more or less of a constant rustle through the
tops of the tall pines, and this in itself would have
deadened other sounds. Then again, the fact of the
two hobo yeggs talking together acted as a buffer,
since they were not so likely to keep their ears on
the alert for suspicious noises from without.</p>
<p>There were Sebattis and Eli turning the last
angle now. That must bring them to the front of
the cabin, where they could crouch down behind
some of the shrubbery that Giraffe remembered
grew on that side. Doubtless the keen-witted
Indian had this very fact in mind when he chose to
pass along to this side of the door, rather than take
the other route; as Giraffe realized he must have
done, simply because in that case he would not have
to pass under a window at all.</p>
<p>Did they mean to suddenly spring into the cabin,
and cover the men before they could snatch up their
guns? Giraffe hoped not, for in that case the rest
of them might not have any share at all in the winding
up of the affair; and all the glory would pass to
Sebattis, Eli, and perhaps Thad and Allan.</p>
<p>But then, the fact that the leaders were now
crouching there would seem to indicate that just
then at least there was no intention of going further.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>So Giraffe, also pulling his long figure forward,
found a place where he too could stretch out, and
with his gun in his trembling hands, wait for the
next move in the game.</p>
<p>Now he remembered what the man with the
heavy voice had just said about meaning to start out
after the sick member of the trio, after he had recovered
his wind. That looked as if Sebattis might
be laying for him there. And when he stepped into
the open, doubtless the two guides expected to suddenly
spring to their feet, at the same time cowering
him by leveling their weapons.</p>
<p>Giraffe realized that perhaps this was rather
queer business for a Boy Scout to be in, rounding
up desperate law breakers; but if Thad thought it
all right, why, there could be no objection.</p>
<p>Some one pushed up against him, and twisting
that wonderful neck of his, Giraffe was able to see
that it was Step Hen, who in turn had arrived, and
taken his position in the line.</p>
<p>Davy was last of all to reach the shelter of the
clump of brushwood, but he came working his way
along on his stomach, and pushing his shotgun
ahead of him as best he knew how; though the
chances were he filled the muzzle with dirt in so
doing, and took chances of having a barrel burst,
should he try and discharge the weapon before
cleaning this out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>Well, they were all there now, and only waiting
for Charlie to be accommodating enough to put in an
appearance. It could not be for long; though with
his nerves all keyed up to concert pitch, Giraffe
thought the seconds were weighted down with lead,
they passed so slowly.</p>
<p>There, was that a movement at last within the
cabin? Some one was certainly crossing the pine-covered
floor with heavy steps. Still, it may have
been the wounded man, limping to new quarters.</p>
<p>Again Giraffe allowed himself to draw in some
of the cool air; for in that second of strain he had
actually stopped breathing.</p>
<p>The crisis was only delayed a little, and was sure
to come along before a great while. He realized
that those after whom he patterned were taking it
calmly; and if they could wait, surely he had no
right to show impatience. Many a plan doubtless
owed its success to this quality of being able to restrain
hasty action; why, Giraffe remembered a saying
to the effect that &ldquo;everything comes to him who
waits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, there it was again, and this time surely it
must be Charlie starting up. The heavy boom of
his voice could be heard, showing that he was even
then advancing toward the open door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I ought to be back again inside an hour,
Kimball; an&rsquo; if so be you kin wait thet long, p&rsquo;raps
Dick, he mout be in trim to tell you what to do
&rsquo;bout thet leg o&rsquo; yourn. Take it as easy as you kin
while I&rsquo;m gone, and make up yer mind as things is
bound to move along arter this as slick as grease,
believe me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>A bulky figure stepped out of the door. Sebattis
waited until he had taken as many as five steps
away, his object being to prevent the man from
bolting back into the cabin, where he could defend
himself with some chance of success.</p>
<p>Then, as though by some preconcerted signal, the
two guides, together with Thad and Allan, suddenly
arose, and swung their guns to their shoulders.
Thinking that this was an invitation for them
to get busy, the other three scouts also scrambled
to their feet, and followed the example of their
leaders.</p>
<p>And that was the astonishing sight the hobo yeggman
saw, as he turned his head upon hearing the
noise made by the boys in gaining their feet.</p>
<h2 id="c26">CHAPTER XXVI.
<br /><span class="small">THE SHERIFF GETS HIS SHOCK, TOO.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Throw up yer hands thar, Charlie Bunch!&rdquo;
Eli had said in a stern voice; and from the fact of
his mentioning another name besides that of Barnes,
Giraffe realized the old Maine guide must have
recognized the yegg bank burglar as one he had
known in long days gone by.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>The big fellow looked ugly for a few seconds, and
Giraffe felt a shiver run up and down his spine, as
he wondered whether he were about to witness a
real desperate battle. But then Charlie, for all his
fierce looks, had a grain of common sense besides.
Doubtless he also knew what kind of man he had
to deal with in old Eli Crookes. And then, it must
have been somewhat discouraging for even the most
daring and reckless of souls to see that grim array
of seven guns, all covering his person, even if five of
the lot were held by boys.</p>
<p>So Charlie gave a sort of make-believe careless
laugh, and obeyed the order of the guide. He even
thrust his hands up higher than there was any real
necessity for doing, as though he believed in going
to the limit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caught at last, and with the goods on, too!&rdquo; he
remarked, in his booming bass voice. &ldquo;How are
you, Eli? So, arter all I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to owe my bein&rsquo;
passed over to a feller I used to chum with. But
we never did git on together, did we, Eli? Say,
Kimball, show yourself here. Come out an&rsquo; jine
in the dance. Thet&rsquo;s the way it allers goes; when
you think things are breaking your way, kerflop she
goes into the soup. Tie me up, Eli, so I can&rsquo;t do any
damage when my mad comes on, like it will when
I gets to thinkin&rsquo; o&rsquo; how near I was to bein&rsquo; fixed
for life.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>A face was seen in the doorway just then, a
frightened face too. Thad swung his gun around,
and covered Kimball, who immediately showed new
signs of alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fire, there!&rdquo; he called out; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all shot
up as &rsquo;tis, an&rsquo; losin&rsquo; pints of blood at a two-forty
rate. I surrender, all right! If Charlie, he gives
in, there ain&rsquo;t no show for a wounded man like me
holding out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep him covered, all the same, Thad, until we
get this other one tied up,&rdquo; advised Allan, who possibly
knew more about the type of rascal they were
dealing with than any other among the scouts.</p>
<p>Eli did the job himself. And that he knew how
to go about it in the right way Charlie himself testified
in no uncertain tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon thet settles my hash, all right,&rdquo; he declared,
as he surveyed the manner in which the stout
cord was passed around his arms, so as to hold them
behind his back when the guide wanted to complete
the tying. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d do fur a sheriff, Eli Crookes.
I s&rsquo;pose this is jest what I ought to expect, after
playin&rsquo; the kind o&rsquo; game I hev all these years; but
I don&rsquo;t give up the ship while there&rsquo;s life. Mebbe
so I kin git away yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was possibly the only thing that had kept
Charlie from putting up a desperate resistance when
he found himself cornered. So long as there was
life there was hope; whereas, if he tried to fight,
and was shot to death, that ended it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>Then Thad had a chance to pay attention to Kimball.
He saw that there was not the slightest chance
for the wounded man to try and escape. He was
really too weak to go far; and besides, that open
cut did seem to be bleeding seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, you just sit down and let me look at that
leg,&rdquo; Thad ordered, after he had searched the man,
and taken from him an ugly looking bulldog revolver
that was an exact contrast with the up-to-date
automatic weapon they had found in Charlie&rsquo;s
pocket, but which he had not dared attempt to reach
when faced by the seven foes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you a surgeon, boy?&rdquo; demanded Kimball,
a note of eagerness in his voice. &ldquo;I hope you are,
because I&rsquo;m feeling in a desperate way. Unless
something&rsquo;s done to stop that flow of blood, why,
I&rsquo;ll be a goner before to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;ll fix that, all right,&rdquo; said Thad, reassuringly.
&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not a surgeon, or only a bungling
one at that; but I do know how to stop a wound
from bleeding. That&rsquo;s one of the things a Boy
Scout learns when he makes up his mind he wants to
get a medal, and reach out for the first class rank.
You watch me, and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was quite an interested audience, for
Giraffe, Davy, Step Hen, Allan, and even the two
guides hovered around, keeping tabs on all that the
patrol leader did.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>Thad first closely examined the mark where the
bullet of Sebattis had cut across Kimball&rsquo;s lower
limb. Then he took a big red bandanna handkerchief
and tied it tightly around the leg, just below
the knee, making sure that the large knot came exactly
on the artery which ran back of the joint.</p>
<p>After that Thad took a stick he had provided,
and inserting this in the handkerchief, he began to
calmly twist it around several times. Of course this
immediately tightened the binding, and the knot
being pressed in against the artery, prevented the
blood from coming to any extent at all.</p>
<p>The man had shut his teeth hard together, but he
groaned once or twice under the operation; though
Thad believed this must be on account of the strain
he was laboring under, rather than because of any
particular bodily agony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, this is only temporary,&rdquo; the scout advised,
after he had washed the wound with some tepid
water, for, acting under his directions, Giraffe had
hastily placed an old pan with some water in it, on
the fire, which evidently Charlie had revived after
finding his bundle intact under the stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to make a litter, and carry you up
to the place we expect to camp to-night,&rdquo; he remarked
a little later, when he had bound the man&rsquo;s
leg up nicely. &ldquo;And to-night I&rsquo;ll see if I can do
something about that partly severed artery. It&rsquo;s
hardly a job for a boy, and I wouldn&rsquo;t try it only
the case is desperate. And it happens that I used to
go around with an uncle of mine who was an old
doctor, and he let me help him lots of times.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>With that Kimball had to rest content. But the
boy had done so splendidly as far as he went, that
the wounded hobo began to hope he might even go
further, and fix the artery, so that the benumbing
bandage could be eased up.</p>
<p>At one time Thad thought of sending one of the
guides up and having the canoes brought back to the
cabin; but for some reason this plan was abandoned.</p>
<p>Giraffe and Davy manufactured the rude litter,
acting under the orders of Allan, who had seen one
used in the past. It would easily hold Kimball, who
was not a heavy weight.</p>
<p>Believing that they might as well make use of the
strapping big hobo, Charlie, as a burden bearer,
Eli unfastened his hands, and made him take the
front end of the litter, while he himself would look
after the rear, with some of the scouts to keep guard
over the prisoner.</p>
<p>Of course in searching the two yeggmen there
had been found the proceeds of their recent robbery,
in the shape of packages of bills, and some gold.
But when the little procession was ready to leave
the cabin, and Thad took up the bundle of old
clothes, which he tossed into the fire, Charlie let out
a yell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! thet&rsquo;s a crazy thing to do, bub; don&rsquo;t you
know what&rsquo;s wrapped up inside them same ole
clothes?&rdquo; he called, evidently greatly excited at the
idea of a fortune burning up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to know, because I put it in there myself,&rdquo;
replied Thad, smiling at the big man&rsquo;s excitement.
&ldquo;You see, Charlie, we began to figure on
why you wanted to get into this same old cabin so
much, and guessed that you had something hid away
here. So we looked around a bit, found the hole
under the stone, took out the boodle you had put
away, fixed up a dummy to fool you; and there you
are. So, let the old stuff go up in smoke. It&rsquo;s just
as well to get rid of the duds that nobody wants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I swan!&rdquo; muttered Charlie, staring hard
at Thad, as though he had begun to suspect that
after all these Boy Scouts were worth considering,
if many of them could do the things this leader
seemed to be capable of, from managing a surprise
party on a poor hobo innocent, to fixing up a
wounded leg that threatened to do for Kimball.</p>
<p>So they went off, taking the back trail; and
Giraffe, who was observing all these things now,
noticed that they passed over exactly the same route
as when heading for the cabin. And he gave Sebattis
credit for a wonderful amount of ingenuity,
which he feared must ever be beyond the capacity
of a tenderfoot scout.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>Of course it was the intention of Thad to take
the litter later on, and acting on the directions which
Charlie promised to give, seek the gully where,
under a shelf of rock, they would find the sick hobo,
Dick, who could also be brought to the camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rather guess we&rsquo;ll have to break up our trip
for a while,&rdquo; Thad remarked to Allan, as they
walked along in company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I can see that plain enough,&rdquo; replied the
other; &ldquo;because we&rsquo;ve had these sick and wounded
hoboes shoved on us, whether we would or not, and
we just can&rsquo;t do anything else. But some of our
crowd can go down the river in a big hurry, and
after handing them over to the authorities in the
first town, come back to you and Sebattis here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d want you to stay with me up here, too,
Allan,&rdquo; remarked Thad, warmly.</p>
<p>In due time they reached the place where the
boats lay, and hearing them approaching, Bumpus
and Jim came ashore. A camp was next in order,
for the boys really wanted to find themselves under
canvas once more. Giraffe exerted himself to get a
fire going, while the tents were being erected, and
Thad with Allan had gone off to bring in the sick
man.</p>
<p>This they had little trouble in doing. Dick was in
a bad way, being feverish; and while Thad gave him
some medicine, he declared that they had better
get the man to a doctor as soon as possible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>So it was determined to make an early start.
They would be up long before sunrise, the tents
stowed, and the boats packed. One more in each
would crowd a whole lot, but the guides thought it
could be done by careful management.</p>
<p>Supper was cooked, and the prisoners given their
share. The wounded man declared he was feeling
considerably better; and Dick too showed signs of
having his high fever broken.</p>
<p>The scouts were lying around in any way they
considered comfortable, while Charlie and Kimball,
with their hands tied behind their backs, and a rope
holding them to a tree, sat there, listening to the
conversation, though not in any too happy a mood
themselves, when there was heard the crash of approaching
footsteps.</p>
<p>Then several figures loomed up, entering the
camp. Sebattis had merely glanced up, but made
no move to reach for his gun; so Giraffe felt that
the danger could not be acute.</p>
<p>Well, of course it was no other than Sheriff
Green, with his posse; and as they advanced they
were holding their guns in such fashion that they
had Charlie and Kimball covered; for evidently they
had not discovered that the pair were tied up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run you down at last, have we, Charlie
Barnes?&rdquo; the sheriff was saying, as he strode forward,
and there was a vein of curiosity as well as
triumph in his voice. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother getting up;
we can put the irons on just as well where you sit.
But hello! if here ain&rsquo;t our young friends the scouts!
What does this mean, I wonder?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<h2 id="c27">CHAPTER XXVII.
<br /><span class="small">DOWN THE RIVER&mdash;CONCLUSION.</span></h2>
<p>At that there was a roar from the scouts that
must have shown the officer how badly he had deceived
himself; but then discovering the two desperate
rascals of whom he was in search, apparently
sitting there, and taking things easy, how was he to
know they were prisoners. Besides, he had eyes
only for them, as he came advancing into camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little too late, Mr. Sheriff,&rdquo; remarked Thad,
advancing to meet the other, &ldquo;we found that in self-defense
we just <i>had</i> to take these gentlemen in out
of the cold ourselves. Besides, one of them was
wounded by Sebattis the other night, and a second
is a pretty sick man, so we&rsquo;re going to send them
down the river in the morning with part of our
force.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course the sheriff was greatly disappointed.
To have his work cut out for him by a parcel of lads
wearing the khaki uniforms of the Boy Scouts was
hard on the officer. And Thad felt that Sheriff
Green must begrudge them the reward that had
been offered for the apprehension of the yeggmen,
and the recovery of the plunder taken from the last
bank they had broken into.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what we&rsquo;ll do, Mr. Green,&rdquo; he remarked,
as they all sat around the fire, with the
three last arrivals enjoying a late supper; &ldquo;suppose
we split that reward for the taking of the hoboes
into three parts. One will go to you, as you gave us
valuable information; another we scouts believe we
deserve; while the third I want our guides to share
among themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a generous offer, my boy,&rdquo; declared the
sheriff. &ldquo;Most people would think they had a right
to it all, as you really do. I accept for myself and
posse. And if you can take the wounded and the
sick man along in your boats, we&rsquo;ll see that Charlie
gets down there all right. Is it a bargain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad glanced around at his chums, and each gave
him a nod in the affirmative. That settled the matter,
for the silent vote had been unanimous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a go, sir, and we take you up on that,&rdquo; declared
the leader of the scout patrol.</p>
<p>Accordingly they talked over the arrangements,
and how they might meet again in the town where
the prisoners could be placed in charge of the authorities,
until the proper officers came to take them
to Augusta.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>Giraffe managed to get Thad alone later on in
the evening. The sheriff was feeling pretty good
after his feed, and sat there by the fire swapping
stories with old Eli, while the rest of the scouts
lay around, listening and laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I noticed that you didn&rsquo;t say anything about
that other pile of stuff we landed under the stone
in the old cabin?&rdquo; remarked Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; answered Thad, readily;
&ldquo;and I kept mum on purpose. In the first place,
it was none of their business, because they knew
nothing about that plunder. And if they knew that
we had it, perhaps it might have made bad feelings.
Just remember, and don&rsquo;t mention it. Of course,
if Charlie happens to give the secret away later on,
when he&rsquo;s with them, that can&rsquo;t be helped. I
wouldn&rsquo;t think of denying it, if they mentioned the
matter right now; but I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s any of
their business. Understand, Giraffe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I do, and let me say I&rsquo;m of the same mind
too,&rdquo; replied the other. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just try and let
Bumpus and Step Hen know, because, you see,
they&rsquo;re kind of easy marks, and apt to talk too
much. If that sharp sheriff ever gets a hint of
what we dug up, he&rsquo;ll want to hear the whole story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, with an experienced officer to look
after Charlie, none of the scouts saw any reason
for anxiety, or losing sleep in fear of the desperate
hobo breaking loose. Thad confined his labors to
the sick and wounded. He had managed to accomplish
that delicate little surgical job with a fair
amount of success, considering his lack of experience.
Kimball was loud in his praise of the
boy&rsquo;s nimble fingers and ready brain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll sure be a great surgeon some day,
younker!&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;That was as nice a job as
many a doctor could have done. And I reckon I&rsquo;m
agoin&rsquo; to get well now, and stand for that twenty
year sentence the judge&rsquo;ll hand out to me. I wish
there had been such a thing as Boy Scouts when I
was young; p&rsquo;raps, then, there&rsquo;d been a different
story to tell about me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad was sitting there, listening to the talk, when
some one plucked him by the sleeve, and looking
up, he saw Sebattis. There was a glitter in the
black eyes of the dusky guide that surprised the
patrol leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get gun&mdash;come &rsquo;long&mdash;think hear moose call
&rsquo;gain,&rdquo; whispered the Indian.</p>
<p>Thad was of course thrilled by this intelligence;
but at the same time he remembered that he had
promised Allan the next chance, in case they had
reason to believe a moose were in the vicinity.</p>
<p>Accordingly, he spoke to the Maine boy, and then
asked the others to kindly moderate their noise;
though Sebattis had already told him that they
would go fully a mile from the camp before answering
the far-away call.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>Again did Sebattis seem to know where he
wanted to wait to see if the moose was to be drawn
near the waiting rifles. He settled down at a certain
place, and sent out the strange call that, heard
in the dead silence of the Maine night, always
makes the blood of the hunter leap wildly through
his veins.</p>
<p>There was an immediate answering call, and
after waiting a little time, they once more sent a
challenge forth.</p>
<p>This was kept up for half an hour, but so far as
Thad could see, no advantage had been gained. Sebattis
was grunting now, every time he called. Perhaps
he began to believe this must be a mighty queer
moose, to send back that rolling defiance, and yet
not advance to any appreciable extent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No good, bull!&rdquo; he finally declared, as they
heard the answer come from some distance, and in
exactly the same quarter as before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if the mountain won&rsquo;t come to Mohammed;
why, he might go to the mountain,&rdquo; Thad suggested;
&ldquo;in other words, chief, what&rsquo;s to hinder us
from heading that way, with you giving him a call
every little while? He&rsquo;ll either have to run away, or
face the music then, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! just like Thad say; Sebattis ready; heap
queer; never know bull like that. Soon see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they moved along, following the guide, who
occasionally sent out a call, Allan took occasion to
say to his chum in a whisper:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s some worked up about that answer, Thad,
and I saw him shake his head. Come to think of it,
I really don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s a moose at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; exclaimed the patrol leader,
quickly; &ldquo;are you trying to tell me Sebattis thinks
some other guide is making all that row, and trying
to call a moose bull to the gun of his employer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I think; and Sebattis does too,&rdquo; replied
Allan, positively. &ldquo;You keep watching him,
and see how he acts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a staggering idea to Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if it should be the very man I&rsquo;m wanting
to see, to hand him my adopted father&rsquo;s important
message, Mr. James W. Carson?&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the chances are, that&rsquo;s just who it&rsquo;ll turn
out to be,&rdquo; replied Allan.</p>
<p>As they advanced, the calls became louder. Evidently
they were approaching the place where that
mysterious bull moose had taken up his stand, and
dared the other on, to lock horns with him in battle.</p>
<p>Presently Sebattis slung his moose call over his
shoulder, and called out aloud:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How there, Louie! You do um purty well;
fool me some time, hey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Voices were heard, followed by a loud laugh; and
then two men appeared, Thad having thrown on the
light of his little electric torch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that Mr. Carson?&rdquo; he called out, as the other
approached.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just who it is; and who may this be?&rdquo; asked the
hunter, who had another Indian guide with him, evidently
from the same village as Sebattis, for they
immediately got together, and began talking in their
own language.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Thad Brewster, and I&rsquo;ve been sent
up here by my guardian, Mr. Caleb Cushman, with
an important communication for you. He tried to
get in touch with you at your home, but learned
that you had started for your annual winter trip
into the woods of the big game country, and might
not come out again until Spring. Please take this
packet, then, Mr. Carson; and if there is any answer
I&rsquo;ll carry it back to my guardian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Carson sat down, and after looking over the
important communication that had followed him so
strangely into the woods, wrote out an answer,
which he entrusted to the keeping of the patrol
leader.</p>
<p>Then he asked many questions, and was deeply
interested in all that he heard concerning the Silver
Fox Patrol of Cranford Troop.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to go back to your camp, and make the
acquaintance of the rest of the boys,&rdquo; he remarked,
as he shook hands with each of the scouts in parting;
&ldquo;but all my plans are laid to leave this section
at daybreak. My guides are going to take me to
where they promise I shall surely get my moose.
You were lucky in having a chance at one. We
came out here to make a last try, and were hoping
our luck had changed when finally an answer came.
But both Louie and myself agreed that the bull was
the most cautious old animal we had ever met up
with. And then, when Sebattis, with whom I have
often hunted, called out, it gave us a shock, I tell
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the boys and Sebattis went back to camp, and
the others were astonished as well as pleased to
know Thad had been able to carry out the wish of
his generous guardian; and that they need no longer
think of dividing their forces in the morning, leaving
Thad, Allan and Sebattis to continue the search,
while the others took the two cripples to the nearest
river town below.</p>
<p>The night passed without any more exciting incidents,
for which the tired boys thought they had
reason to be grateful; for of late their sleep had not
been as sound as they might have wished, and every
one of them had much to make up. And besides,
now that Thad had delivered his message to Mr.
Carson, his mind was free from worry.</p>
<p>With the coming of early dawn they were astir.
Every scout had his particular duty to perform.
Two of them stowed the tents away in the smallest
compass possible; another couple began to pack the
canoes; while Thad and Bumpus assisted in getting
breakfast; or rather the latter did, for the patrol
leader had his hands full in attending to his patients,
Dick and Kimball.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</div>
<p>The sun had hardly appeared above the horizon
when they were once more afloat. Again did the
merry paddles send the sparkling foam toward the
stern of each slender canoe, as they headed downstream.</p>
<p>Sheriff Green had declared that he would take
Charlie about six or seven miles down to a place
where he knew he could get the use of a large boat,
capable of carrying four men; and in this he expected
to arrive at civilization not a great many
hours after the others did.</p>
<p>By changing the cargoes it was found possible
to carry the two extra passengers, especially since
neither of them happened to be a large man.</p>
<p>The boys were as happy as larks as they swept
down the river. They laughed, joked and sang by
the hour, because now there was no longer any
reason for keeping silent, since they were passing
out of the big game country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not near half of our time is up,&rdquo; Giraffe
would remark frequently; &ldquo;and after we get these
two cripples safely landed, why, we mean to make
a fresh start. Allan says he&rsquo;ll show us another
trail, where we c&rsquo;n meet up with a new lot of adventures,
have some fine hunting, and see more of
these great Maine woods. For one I&rsquo;m just hopin&rsquo;
we&rsquo;ll run up against a pack of them fierce old wolves
like we heard howlin&rsquo; near our cabin that night. A
bear is all well enough, but I&rsquo;ve always wanted to
bag a wolf, the worst kind.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to run the whole
shootin&rsquo; match,&rdquo; remarked Bumpus significantly.
&ldquo;There are others, Giraffe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! sounds like Bumpus has changed his
mind, and feels like he had ought to own a gun of
some kind too!&rdquo; declared Step Hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, he does,&rdquo; Bumpus hastened to declare,
boldly. &ldquo;If other Boy Scouts c&rsquo;n carry
weapons in the woods, I don&rsquo;t see why I hadn&rsquo;t
ought to have the same privilege. My folks don&rsquo;t
like the ijee very much; but then a feller&rsquo;s just got
to keep up with the procession. And it&rsquo;ll be the
makin&rsquo; of me, I guess, if somethin&rsquo; coaxes me to get
out in the woods, and walk miles every chance that
comes along. Let&rsquo;s look at that fine little gun of
yours again, Step Hen. If I only can get one,
that&rsquo;s my idea of a clever shooter. And it don&rsquo;t
wear a feller&rsquo;s shoulder out, either, carryin&rsquo; the
same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to hear it, Bumpus; and I reckon you&rsquo;ll be
able to afford a gun, with all your share of the fat
rewards ahead. If you say so, I&rsquo;ll go to the gun
store with you, and help pick out a good one. You
really ought to have an experienced hand along at
such a time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</div>
<p>Thad and Allan exchanged glances at this remark
on the part of Step Hen; for they knew full well
that his rifle had been purchased entirely through
the advice of the patrol leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Step Hen,&rdquo; Bumpus was heard to
say sweetly in reply; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be only too glad to have
you along. But I&rsquo;ve got one important piece of
business to look after the minute I get ashore, and
within reach of a telegraph office. If it busts my
pocketbook I&rsquo;m sure goin&rsquo; to send a wire to our
bank cashier, and ask him if I did deliver that letter
my dad told me was so important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I should think you&rsquo;d rather send the message
to your own house?&rdquo; Giraffe suggested, with
a wink toward Thad, for the canoes were all close
together at the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; exclaimed the stout scout, drawing in a
long breath. &ldquo;Well, now, I&rsquo;d just be afraid to hear
the news from headquarters, you know. What if
they had lost their lovely home and all because of
my stupid forgetfulness, d&rsquo;ye think I could stand it
to stay up here weeks longer, havin&rsquo; fun? No, I&rsquo;ve
got it all mapped out, and know just what I want
to say to the cashier. And believe me, I&rsquo;m hopin&rsquo;
for the best, fellers. Have a little pity on me, won&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do feel for you, old fellow,&rdquo; said Step Hen,
who was drawn toward Bumpus more than ever, on
account of this unconscious flattery regarding his
new gun; and besides, boy though he was, he could
see that the other was really laboring under a heavy
strain, and actually suffering from the pangs of remorse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">[251]</div>
<p>What the number of miles might be they covered
that day, no one dared even guess; but although
they fairly flew at times, owing to the combined
work of current and paddles, another night had to
be spent on the way. But about noon of the second
day they realized that they were getting on the
borders of civilization again. A dog barking was
the first sign, and then came the clarion crow of a
barnyard rooster.</p>
<p>Afterwards a house appeared, then several more;
and far beyond the spire of a church reared itself
against the clear heavens.</p>
<p>Bumpus looked frightfully pale&mdash;for him. He
knew that the time had come when he might learn
the facts as connected with that letter, the disposal
of which he had never been able to solve; since the
more he tried the greater became his confusion of
ideas.</p>
<p>And about the hour of noon the canoes were
turned in toward the shore, for they saw the town
of Grindstone before them, with the railroad leading
southwest in the direction of the homes that
were so far away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">[252]</div>
<p>Hardly waiting for the landing to be made,
Bumpus got ashore, and was seen hurrying off into
the town. They knew that he had in mind the
station, where he could send off a hurry message;
and Step Hen, receiving a word from Thad,
hastened after the fat boy, so as to make sure he
did not get into any trouble.</p>
<p>Once at the station Bumpus, who had made a
rough draft of what he wanted to wire the cashier,
gave it over to the keeping of the agent, and asked
that it be sent at once. He would sit down and wait
for the answer.</p>
<p>The clicking of the nimble telegraph key was
about the only sound that disturbed the silence in
that station, for trains were evidently few and far
between on the Aroostook railroad.</p>
<p>It may have been an hour that dragged past, and
it may have been much more, Bumpus declared he
had aged terribly since coming there; and Step Hen
tried all he knew how, to keep the other&rsquo;s spirits up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, he&rsquo;s taking a message right now, and it
may be for you, Bumpus!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>A minute later, the operator came toward them,
holding out a yellow paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the answer from Cranford,&rdquo; the telegraph
man remarked, with a smile; and Bumpus
could hardly take the sheet, his hands trembled so
terribly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">[253]</div>
<p>Less than ten minutes later, a very stout youth,
clad partly in the uniform of the Boy Scout organization,
might have been seen running wildly down
toward the river, followed closely by another, evidently
belonging to the same patrol. And as Bumpus
ran, he was waving above his head a yellow
sheet of paper, while he let out frequent roars, that
seemed to be fashioned on one key, and that of joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s come, fellers!&rdquo; was the burden of his
whoops; &ldquo;and I did my duty all right, just like I
always said I must a done. He says I delivered the
letter that mornin&rsquo;, when I met him on the street.
That makes me happy, and I&rsquo;m ready to buy the
best gun I c&rsquo;n get in this town, and stay up in the
Maine woods a whole month, if the rest of you
want me to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did stay some weeks longer, and met with a
series of strange adventures, that some of the boys
believed really excelled those that had befallen them
in the Penobscot region. What these happenings
were, and just how Thad and his five chums acted
their parts most manfully in the face of many difficulties
will be found recorded in the pages of the
next volume of this series, now published under
the title of &ldquo;The Boy Scouts in the Maine Woods,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;A New Test for the Silver Fox Patrol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, Bumpus,&rdquo; remarked Thad, later,
as they sat around, taking their ease, &ldquo;did the
cashier tell you what the nature of that communication
was; and did it turn out to be so dreadfully
important?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpus grew red in the face and grinned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">[254]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! shucks! I s&rsquo;pose you all have just <i>got</i> to
know,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;It was on&rsquo;y a line from my
dad, tellin&rsquo; the cashier he&rsquo;d lunch with him that
same day, and take him out in his new Alco car.
You know my dad&rsquo;s the president of the bank, but
he&rsquo;s been sick at home for a long time, and had
to get a car to take him out in the air. But who
cares for expenses; gimme two cents&rsquo; worth of
gingersnaps? I&rsquo;m feelin&rsquo; fine right now&rsquo;, and c&rsquo;n
afford to laugh at all my silly worryin&rsquo;. Might a
known a scout wouldn&rsquo;t do such a silly thing as to
forget an important message. Shucks! Step Hen,
let&rsquo;s go around and see if we can find that gun anywhere.
I&rsquo;ve got the money to buy it all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course the boys understood that the pretended
anxiety of Bumpus in connection with trouble coming
to his family through carelessness on his part
had all been put on; but what he had feared was
the reproaches of his father, who had long been
trying to cure him of this same fault.</p>
<p>The two injured men had been handed over to
the proper authorities, and a doctor was even then
examining what Thad had done for Kimball.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You owe this lad a lot of thanks, my friend,&rdquo;
the doctor said; &ldquo;he certainly has done a very neat
job in uniting the lips of that artery. I&rsquo;m afraid
you&rsquo;d have passed in your checks for a certainty,
only for the prompt first aid to the injured which
you received;&rdquo; and Thad felt amply repaid when
he thus learned that after all, his crude work had
not been so clumsy as he had feared at the time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">[255]</div>
<p>To dispose of the three hobo yeggmen, it might
be stated that they were eventually sentenced to
various terms in the penitentiary. The reward,
which had been increased to two thousand dollars,
was paid over to the boys, and by them divided,
just as Thad had proposed. And everybody seemed
more than satisfied.</p>
<p>But of course that was only a small part of what
was coming the way of the six scouts. Thad soon
learned that the bank recently robbed had also
offered a reward for the recovery of the bonds that
had been taken; and this eventually fell into the
treasury of the Silver Fox Patrol.</p>
<p>Then there was that other plunder, which had
been found under the stone in the old cabin of the
trapper, away up the river in the big game country.
Doubtless the plundered bank would be delighted
to pay a big sum for the return of those valuable
documents, not to mention the cash that had also
been recovered.</p>
<p>Thad did not have the time just then to open up
communications, for he wanted to be off with his
chums on another trip in a different direction; and
one that Allan had wished they could take at the
time they were compelled to follow on the trail of
Mr. James W. Carson. So Thad placed the sealed
packet in the safe of a gentleman whom Allan
chanced to know right well, and who promised to
open negotiations with the robbed bank, while the
scouts were up in the woods.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">[256]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure,&rdquo; the gentleman remarked, &ldquo;that
there is a very nice sum offered in this case; and if
so, you lads are to be congratulated indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means a trip out West next summer for our
whole patrol; and a hunt in the wild Rock Mountains;&rdquo;
declared Bumpus, who was now wearing a
perpetual smile, because of the good news he had
received from Cranford.</p>
<p>And it turned out that they did receive a splendid
purse from the bank people, who were overjoyed to
get back papers that were of tremendous value to
them, even if of little account to others. What this
amount was there is really no necessity of telling;
but it was enough, added to all the rest they received,
to make the six boys the happiest fellows in
all the great state of Maine. And doubtless, even
before they knew to a certainty just what they were
going to receive, it can be set down for a fact that
they would start out on the second half of their
vacation in the Maine woods with lighter hearts
than they had known for many a day.</p>
